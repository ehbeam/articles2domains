 Cognitive regulation is often used to influence behavioral outcomes. However, the computational and neurobiological mechanisms by which it affects behavior remain unknown. We studied this issue using an fMRI task in which human participants used cognitive regulation to up- and down-regulate their cravings for foods at the time of choice. We found that activity in both ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) correlated with value. We also found evidence that two distinct regulatory mechanisms were at work: value modulation, which operates by changing the values assigned to foods in vmPFC and dlPFC at the time of choice, and behavioral control modulation, which operates by changing the relative influence of the vmPFC and dlPFC value signals on the action selection process used to make choices. In particular, during down-regulation, activation decreased in the value-sensitive region of dlPFC (indicating value modulation) but not in vmPFC, and the relative contribution of the two value signals to behavior shifted towards the dlPFC (indicating behavioral control modulation). The opposite pattern was observed during up-regulation: activation increased in vmPFC but not dlPFC, and the relative contribution to behavior shifted towards the vmPFC. Finally, ventrolateral PFC and posterior parietal cortex were more active during both up- and down-regulation, and were functionally connected with vmPFC and dlPFC during cognitive regulation, which suggests that they help to implement the changes to the decision-making circuitry generated by cognitive regulation. 
 
 
 
 The human brain makes rapid evaluations that lead to adaptive choices ( Lebreton et al., 2009 ;  Milosavljevic et al., 2010 ), but good decisions often require further processing. Cognitive regulation of decision-making uses attention, language, and executive control to modulate decisions, and features prominently in therapeutic treatments for disorders like obesity and addiction ( Beck et al., 1993 ). While understanding of the computational and neurobiological mechanisms of unregulated choice has grown substantially ( Rangel et al., 2008 ;  Rushworth et al., 2009 ), we know little about how cognitive regulation affects them. 
 A growing consensus suggests that decision-making involves two distinct processes that interact over time ( Montague and Berns, 2002 ;  Rangel et al., 2008 ;  Kable and Glimcher, 2009 ;  Basten et al., 2010 ;  Rangel and Hare, 2010 ;  Hare et al., 2011b ). First, a valuation system represents the value of options under consideration. Concurrently, a comparator system receives these value representations as input to an accumulator-based action selection process ( Busemeyer and Townsend, 1993 ;  Sugrue et al., 2005 ;  Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008 ;  Krajbich et al., 2010 ;  Milosavljevic et al., 2010 ). During this process, a relative value signal for each possible action accumulates over time based on the value of its corresponding option. Choice occurs when the accumulated signal for one action becomes sufficiently strong. 
 These findings suggest two mechanisms through which cognitive regulation could impact choices:  value modulation,  which changes the values assigned to stimuli, and  behavioral control modulation,  which changes the weight given to values during the action selection process. For example, a dieter considering whether to eat ice cream or broccoli could make a healthy choice by decreasing the value assigned to ice cream (i.e. value modulation), or by ignoring ice cream's value and simply reaching for broccoli (i.e. behavioral control modulation). 
 Although the neural basis of cognitive regulation during emotional responding (e.g. to affective photographs) has been widely investigated ( Ochsner et al., 2004 ;  Delgado et al., 2008 ;  Wager et al., 2008 ;  Kober et al., 2010 ), the computational and neurobiological mechanisms of cognitive regulation during  decision-making  remain largely unknown. This distinction is important. Although decision-making likely shares common processes with emotional responding (e.g. subjective valuation), the need to translate values into behaviors with real consequences also likely involves unique computations, including the action selection process described above. Moreover, the evolution over time of the valuation and action selection processes, as well as their interaction ( Hare et al., 2011b ;  Hunt et al., 2012 ;  Sokol-Hessner, 2012 ) suggests that cognitive regulation of decision-making may involve processes and time courses distinct from cognitive regulation of emotional responding. 
 We report the results of an fMRI task in which hungry subjects made real food purchase decisions in a natural control condition or under explicit cognitive regulation instructions. The experimental design allowed us to address three questions: 1) Does cognitive regulation during decision-making operate through value modulation, behavioral control modulation, or both? 2) Do the effects of cognitive regulation change over the time course of a decision? 3) What are the neural mechanisms used to orchestrate changes in the decision-making circuitry during cognitive regulation? 
 
 Materials and Methods 
 
 Subjects 
 Twenty-six healthy, right-handed individuals with normal or corrected-to-normal vision (nine female, mean age = 22, range = 19-28) participated in the study. Subjects were eligible only if they reported frequent consumption of the types of foods used in the study and had no history of psychiatric or neurological conditions. Data for six additional participants were excluded from analysis: five exhibited excessive head motion during scanning, and one gave all foods the same minimum liking rating (“Not at all liked”). Subjects were paid $50 for participation and given an initial endowment of $2.50 with which to purchase foods during the study. Caltech's Institutional Review Board approved all procedures. 
 
 
 Procedure 
 Subjects were instructed to fast for at least four hours prior to the experiment, and ate at most a light meal before fasting began. They were also told that at the end of the experiment they would remain in the lab for 30 minutes, during which time they could eat only what they had obtained during the study. The task consisted of two parts: an initial liking rating task (i.e. an unbiased measure of value) and an in-scanner bidding and regulation task (i.e. a measure of value under the influence of regulation). 
 During the initial liking-rating task, subjects were shown pictures of 150 different appetizing snack food items (e.g., chips, candy) and rated how much they would like to eat each food at the end of the experiment, at their own pace, using a six point Likert-scale (1= “Don't want it at all”, 6=“Want it very strongly”). These liking ratings provided a measure of the baseline value assigned to each food in the absence of explicit cognitive regulation. 
 Immediately afterwards subjects received instructions for the bidding and regulation task ( Fig. 1A ). On each trial before the food appeared, participants saw an abstract black and white symbol indicating one of three trial types: DISTANCE, INDULGE, and NATURAL. Each type of trial appeared 50 times, randomly interspersed over three scanning runs. On DISTANCE trials, participants were asked to use any strategy they needed to  decrease  their craving for the food. On INDULGE trials, they were asked to use any strategy they needed to  increase  their craving. On NATURAL trials, they were asked to allow whatever thoughts and feelings came naturally. Subjects had 4 s to evaluate the item, and were asked to look at the food and engage in the regulation task during this entire time. We chose this length to ensure that subjects had sufficient time to deploy cognitive regulation ( Gross, 1998 ), and to investigate whether modulation took place during food evaluation, during response initiation, or both. 
 After the 4 second delay, participants had 2 seconds in which to place a bid ($0-$2.50, $0.50 increments) for the right to eat that food at the end of scanning, with one trial selected randomly for implementation at the end of the experiment. The bid on that trial determined whether subjects got to eat that food and the price that they paid, according to the rules of a Becker-DeGroot-Marschak auction ( Becker et al., 1964 ;  Plassmann et al., 2007 ). Critically, the rules of the auction ensure that subjects' best strategy is to bid their true value for each food. For details on the auction procedure and why they induce truth-telling see  Plassmann et al. (2007) . These bids allowed us to measure values expressed in behavior at the time of choice. Failure to respond within 2 sec. resulted in a bid of $0. 
 
 
 MRI Data Acquisition 
 Functional imaging was conducted using a Siemens 3.0 Tesla MRI scanner (Erlangen, Germany) to acquire gradient echo T2*-weighted echoplanar (EPI) images. To optimize functional sensitivity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a key region of interest, we used a tilted acquisition in an oblique orientation of 30° to the anterior commissure–posterior commissure line. In addition, we used an eight-channel phased array coil that yields a 40% signal increase in signal in the vmPFC over a standard head coil. Each volume comprised 44 axial slices. A total of 675 volumes were collected over three sessions during the experiment in an interleaved ascending manner. The first two volumes of each session were discarded to allow for scanner equilibration. The imaging parameters were as follows: echo time, 30 ms; field of view, 192 mm; in-plane resolution and slice thickness, 3 mm; repetition time, 2.75 s. Whole-brain high resolution T1-weighted structural scans (1 × 1 × 1 mm) were acquired and coregistered with the participant's mean EPI images. These images were averaged together to permit anatomical localization of the functional activations at the group level. 
 
 
 MRI Data Preprocessing 
 Image analysis was performed using SPM5 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, London, UK). Images were corrected for slice acquisition time within each volume, motion corrected with realignment to the last volume, spatially normalized to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute EPI template, and spatially smoothed using a Gaussian kernel with a full width at half maximum of 8 mm. Intensity normalization and high-pass temporal filtering (using a filter width of 128 s) were also applied to the data. 
 
 
 MRI Data Analysis 
 To address the questions raised in the introduction, we estimated several general linear models (GLMs) of BOLD responses with first-order autoregression. Every GLM was estimated in three steps. First, we estimated the model separately for each individual. Second, we calculated contrast statistics at the individual level. Third, we computed second-level statistics by carrying out one-sample t tests on the single-subject contrast coefficients. 
 
 Tests for value and behavioral control modulation 
 We applied the following logic to test for evidence of value and behavioral control modulation. First, we used GLM-1 (details below) to identify regions that might be involved in the computation of value information at the time of choice. We did this by looking for areas in which the BOLD responses were correlated with the bids during NATURAL trials, which provide a control condition without cognitive regulation. We also verified that computations during NATURAL trials were not significantly affected by the presence of regulation (GLM-1A) by identifying regions that correlated with the unbiased, pre-scan liking ratings during NATURAL trials. Second, we tested for value modulation by examining average responses (i.e. no parametric modulation) in these value-related regions, which should go down during DISTANCE trials and up during INDULGE trials. Third, we tested for behavioral control modulation by examining the correlation between signals in value-related regions and behavioral responses (i.e. parametric modulation with bids). If regulation reduces (or enhances) the weight that a particular value-related region receives in the action selection process, we should observe reduction (or enhancement) of the correlation between that value region and the bids. 
 
 GLM-1 
 This GLM consisted of six regressors of interest: R1-R3 were indicator functions denoting NATURAL trials (R1), DISTANCE trials (R2) and INDULGE trials (R3), while R4-R6 consisted of parametric modulators of each indicator function representing the value of the participant's bids for that trial type. Indicator functions consisted of a box-car function beginning at food onset and terminating at the bid response (average duration ∼4.7 s). Missed response trials were modeled as a separate regressor, with duration of the average trial length (4.7 s). All regressors were convolved with the canonical form of the hemodynamic response. The model also included motion parameters and session constants as regressors of no interest. 
 To test for value modulation, for which we expect changes in average activation, we computed the contrasts of DISTANCE vs. NATURAL trials (R2 − R1), INDULGE vs. NATURAL trials (R3 − R1), and INDULGE vs. DISTANCE trials (R3 − R2). To test for behavioral control modulation, for which we expect changes in the correlates of bid, we computed the contrasts of the bid parametric modulator on DISTANCE vs. NATURAL trials (R5 − R4), the bid parametric modulator on INDULGE vs. NATURAL trials (R6 − R4), and the bid parametric modulator on INDULGE vs. DISTANCE trials (R6 − R5). 
 Regions are reported as significant if they passed whole-brain cluster correction (WBC) at p < .05 as implemented by the SPM5 data analysis software ( Worsley et al., 1996 ), using a per-voxel threshold of  P  < .001. 
 We also had a strong  a priori  interest in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) because research in the decision-making and self-control literatures points to the particular importance of these regions ( Kable and Glimcher, 2007 ;  Plassmann et al., 2007 ;  Hare et al., 2009 ;  Sokol-Hessner, 2012 ). We thus also report results surviving small-volume correction within a combined anatomical mask of the following three regions: vmPFC, right and left dlPFC. Using WFU PickAtlas ( http://fmri.wfubmc.edu/software/PickAtlas ), the vmPFC was defined by a mask of the cingulate gyrus, restricted to the 234 voxels falling below the genu of the corpus callosum. This region encompasses the peak voxels related to value computation in several independent studies (e.g.,  McClure et al., 2004 ;  Chib et al., 2009 ;  Hare et al., 2009 ), and shares similar boundaries to a subregion of the mPFC defined by distinct patterns of both anatomical and functional connectivity (Cluster 2,  Beckmann et al., 2009 ). The dlPFC was defined using a mask of the middle frontal gyrus, restricted to Brodmann areas 9, 10, and 46 (using a dilation of 3 to ensure coverage of all voxels in the area, yielding 996 voxels on the right, 922 voxels on the left). This region encompasses the peak voxels reported for value computations in the dlPFC in several studies ( Plassmann et al., 2007 ;  Plassmann et al., 2010 ), as well as the peak dlPFC voxel reported in delayed valuation ( McClure et al., 2004 ). 
 
 
 GLM-1A 
 This model was identical to GLM-1, except that bids (R4−R6) were replaced by the unregulated, pre-scan liking ratings of each food as the parametric modulator. GLM-2 allowed us to determine the extent to which unregulated liking ratings identified the same areas as online bids during NATURAL trials, a measure of the extent to which the presence of regulation trials contaminated natural response. 
 
 
 
 Analysis of the time course of regulation 
 To test for evidence of the evolution over time of either value modulation or behavioral control modulation, we used GLM-2 to look for significant changes in average activation and/or correlation with bid that varied as a function of time (early during the evaluation process versus late during response initiation). 
 
 GLM-2 
 This GLM consisted of twelve regressors of interest: R1) Early period for NATURAL trials; R2) Late period for NATURAL trials; R3) Early period for DISTANCE trials; R4) Late period for DISTANCE trials; R5) Early period for INDULGE trials; R6) Late period for INDULGE trials. Early period regressors (R1, R3, R5) were modeled as 0-s stick functions at food onset in each trial type. Late period regressors (R2, R4, R6) were modeled as 0-s stick functions 4 seconds after food onset, at the end of the evaluation period and the beginning of response elicitation. R7−R12 consisted of parametric modulators of R1−R6, representing the bid entered for each trial. Note that parametric modulators for early and late periods for a given trial type are identical (since only one bid per trial was entered), but that the correlation between these regressors when convolved with the hemodynamic response is quite low, because of the four-second lag between them (range  r  = −.01 to −.32, mean  r  = −.19). Non-response trials were modeled with two separate regressors for the early and late period. 
 The coefficients from these regressors were used to estimate the following interactions with time, which were calculated first at the subject level, and then submitted to group-level random effects analysis. First, to test for effects of value modulation that varied over time, we examined the difference between conditions in unmodulated activation early vs. late in the trial, looking at 1) the regulation (DISTANCE vs. NATURAL) × time (Late vs. Early) contrast ([R4−R2] − [R3−R1]), 2) the regulation (INDULGE vs. NATURAL) × time (Late vs. Early) contrast ([R6 − R2] − [R5 − R1]), and 3) the regulation (INDULGE vs. DISTANCE) × time (Late vs. Early) contrast ([R6 − R4] − [R5 − R3]). Second, to test for effects of behavioral-control modulation that varied over time, we examined the difference between conditions in bid parametric modulator early vs. late in the trial, looking at 1) the regulation (DISTANCE vs. NATURAL) × time (Late vs. Early) contrast ([R10−R8] − [R9 − R7]), 2) the regulation (INDULGE vs. NATURAL) × time (Late vs. Early) contrast ([R12 − R8] − [R11 − R7]), and 3) the regulation (INDULGE vs. DISTANCE) × time (Late vs. Early) contrast ([R12 − R10] − [R11 − R9]). Post-hoc tests decomposing these interaction effects into the contribution of early and late time points separately (e.g. DISTANCE vs. NATURAL at early time point only, R3 − R1) were also computed. 
 
 
 
 Reaction Time Analyses 
 In order to ascertain whether the effects identified in GLM 3 were accounted for by differences in reaction time between the conditions, we used a modified version of GLM 3 which was identical to that described above, with the exception that the reaction time on each trial was used as a parametric modulator of R2 (Late period for NATURAL trials), R4 (Late period for DISTANCE trials) and R6 (late period for INDULGE trials). The bid was entered as a second parametric modulator orthogonalized to reaction times in each condition. Results of this model were not substantially different, so we report the results of the simpler model (GLM-2) in the Results section below. 
 
 
 Analysis of Neural Systems Implementing Cognitive Regulation 
 To identify regions that may be responsible for orchestrating changes in the decision-making circuitry, we used GLM-1 to identify the conjunction of regions that were more active during both DISTANCE vs. NATURAL trials (GLM1: R2 − R1) and during INDULGE vs. NATURAL trials (R3 − R1). We focus here on three regions which have also been implicated in cognitive regulation of emotional responding ( Ochsner and Gross, 2005 ): left and right ventrolateral PFC, and left posterior parietal cortex. To determine whether and how these regions were functionally connected to the value-based decision-making circuitry during regulation, we performed six separate psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses, one each for the left and right vlPFC and left PPC. The vlPFC and PPC regions were defined by the set of voxels in each region active for the contrast (DISTANCE + INDULGE) – NATURAL Trials, thresholded at p < .001, uncorrected, from GLM 1. 
 
 PPI 1 
 This PPI was designed to examine whether activity in the left vlPFC was differentially correlated with vmPFC or dlPFC responses in DISTANCE compared to NATURAL trials. This was done following the procedures described in  Gitelman et al., (2003)  and implemented in SPM. 
 First, we computed individual average time-series within a 4 mm sphere surrounding individual subject peaks for the contrast DISTANCE vs. NATURAL (GLM 1), within the functional mask of left vlPFC as defined above. Variance associated with the six motion regressors was removed from the extracted time-series. The seed time-courses were then deconvolved, based on the formula for the canonical hemodynamic response, in order to construct a time series of neural activity in left vlPFC. 
 Second, we estimated a GLM with the following regressors: R1) An interaction between the neural activity in the seed region and a contrast of the indicator functions for DISTANCE trials (∼4.7s) vs. NATURAL trials (∼4.7s), with DISTANCE weighted as +1, and NATURAL weighted as -1; R2) The contrast of DISTANCE vs. NATURAL trials (+1 for DISTANCE trials, -1 for NATURAL trials, 0 elsewhere); R3) The original BOLD eigenvariate (i.e. the average time-series from the 4mm sphere). The first two regressors were convolved with a canonical form of the hemodynamic response. The model also included covariates of no interest (motion parameters and session constants). 
 Third, single subject contrasts for the first regressor were calculated and submitted to a one-sample t-test on the single subject contrast coefficients to determine group activations. 
 
 
 PPI 2 
 This model is identical to PPI 1, except that the first and second regressors used the contrast INDULGE vs. NATURAL trials. 
 
 
 PPI 3-4 
 This model is identical to PPIs 1 and 2, but is calculated using as a seed region the right vlPFC region as defined above. 
 
 
 PPI 5-6 
 These models are identical to PPIs 1 and 2, but are calculated using as a seed region the left PPC region as defined above. 
 We also conducted PPI analyses analyzing changes in connectivity early vs. late in the evaluation period. However, these did not reveal strong effects of time on connectivity, so we do not discuss them further. 
 
 
 
 Time Course Plots 
 To examine the time course of activation on DISTANCE, NATURAL, and INDULGE trials, we defined regions of interest (ROIs) in the vmPFC and right and left dlPFC based on the set of voxels showing a significant 2 (condition: INDULGE vs. DISTANCE) × 2 (time: Late vs. Early) interaction in the correlation between neural response and bid at  P  < .001 ( Fig. 2 ). We also defined ROIs in the vlPFC and PPC based on the set of voxels showing a conjunction between DISTANCE and INDULGE trials compared to NATURAL at  P  < .001 ( Fig. 4 ). From each of these ROIs we extracted the average raw BOLD time signal at each time point, removing both the mean and the variance associated with the motion regressors using standard SPM functions. The resulting time course was then upsampled using spline interpolation into 10 time bins per TR (275 ms per sample) and subjected to finite impulse response (FIR) analysis for each ROI. This FIR model included three regressors for the main effects of condition (DISTANCE, NATURAL, INDULGE) and three regressors for the bid parametric modulator at each time bin falling within 20 seconds of the onset of a trial (73 time bins total). Coefficients for the bid parametric modulator were used to make the time course plots shown in  Fig. 3 , and coefficients for the main effect of condition were used to make the time course plots in  Fig. 5 . 
 
 
 
 
 Results 
 
 Behavioral Results 
 The cognitive regulation instructions had a significant effect on average bidding behavior ( F 2,50  = 43.03, p < .001,  Fig. 1B ). Post-hoc t-tests revealed that, compared to NATURAL trials (M = $0.92, s.e. = .06), participants bid less in DISTANCE (M = $0.68, s.e. = .07, paired- t 25  = 6.48,  P  < .001), and more in INDULGE trials (M = $1.15, s.e. = .08, paired-t 25  = 5.51,  P  < .001). Regulation instructions also had a significant effect on the relationship between pre-scan liking ratings and bids ( F 2,50  = 5.42, p =.007), although this varied by condition. Post-hoc t-tests on the Fisher-transformed z-scores suggested that, compared to the correlation in NATURAL trials (M = .73, s.e. = .02), DISTANCE trials were significantly less correlated with pre-scan ratings (M = .65, s.e. = .03, paired-t 25  = 3.07, p = .005), but there was no difference for INDULGE trials (M = .71, s.e. =.03). Reaction time (RT) also differed among all conditions ( F 2,50  = 12.08, p < .001, all post-hoc paired-t 25  > 2.36, all  P  < .03). DISTANCE trials took longest (RT = 790 ms, s.e. = 41ms), followed by INDULGE trials (RT = 745 ms, s.e. = 38 ms), with the quickest RT in NATURAL trials (RT = 695 ms, s.e. = 37ms). This suggests that both types of regulation required effort, with attempts to decrease responses being more difficult. 
 
 
 Regions Correlating with Bids in the Absence of Regulation 
 We identified candidates for regions associated with the computation of value in the absence of regulation by estimating a general linear model (GLM) of BOLD responses in each condition during the full evaluation period (from the appearance of the food stimulus to the bid response), with activity parametrically modulated by the bid placed on that trial (GLM-1). For NATURAL trials, activity in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), as well as regions of ventral striatum and parietal cortex, correlated with the bids (all  P  < .01, whole-brain corrected [WBC],  Table 1 ). We found similar results if activity in NATURAL trials was parametrically modulated by the liking ratings taken prior to the scanning session, instead of the bids (GLM-1A,  Table 1 ). This suggests that the mere presence of cognitive regulation did not significantly alter value computations on NATURAL trials. For convenience, we refer in the remainder of the text to the regions of dlPFC and vmPFC correlated with bidding behavior as “value-related regions”. 
 
 
 Tests for Value Modulation 
 Value modulation predicts that, compared to NATURAL trials, the average strength of stimulus value signals in value-related regions like vmPFC and dlPFC should be lower in DISTANCE trials, and higher in INDULGE trials. To test for this, we compared average (i.e. no parametric modulation by bid) BOLD responses across conditions. We tested first for value modulation effects that were significant when averaging over the entire evaluation period (GLM-1,  Table 2 ) and second for value modulation effects that showed a significant interaction with time (GLM-2,  Table 3 ). We focus our discussion here on analyses in ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, both because these regions have previously been implicated in stimulus valuation at the time of choice ( Kable and Glimcher, 2007 ;  Plassmann et al., 2007 ;  Basten et al., 2010 ;  Plassmann et al., 2010 ;  Sokol-Hessner, 2012 ), and because we were particularly interested in clarifying their respective roles in decision-making during cognitive regulation. We also highlight effects in other regions when they overlapped with areas that correlated with value during NATURAL trials. 
 As shown in  Fig. 2 , when averaging over the full evaluation period, BOLD responses were significantly lower in DISTANCE compared to NATURAL trials in right dlPFC ( P  = .04, small-volume corrected), but not in vmPFC. In contrast, average BOLD in INDULGE compared to NATURAL trials was marginally higher in vmPFC (41 voxels at  P  = .005, uncorrected), and lower in dlPFC (p = .05, SVC). A direct comparison of DISTANCE to INDULGE trials confirmed greater response in the vmPFC during INDULGE trials  (P  = .001, SVC , P  = .03, WBC), and was not significant within the dlPFC at our omnibus threshold. 
 To examine whether the impact of the regulation instructions on the average BOLD signals changed over time across the trial (GLM-2,  Table 3 ,  Late vs. Early contrast ), we divided the evaluation period into early (immediately after food onset) and late (beginning of response initiation) phases, and estimated the strength of the 2 (Condition: DISTANCE vs. NATURAL, INDULGE vs. NATURAL, or INDULGE vs. DISTANCE) × 2 (Time: Late vs. Early) interaction on average activation. Within regions showing significant effects of this interaction (i.e. differences in the effect of regulation over time), we conducted post-hoc ROI-based analyses, decomposing the same comparison (DISTANCE vs. NATURAL, INDULGE vs. NATURAL, or INDULGE vs. DISTANCE) into effects at the early or late time-points only. This allowed us to determine whether the interaction was driven primarily by early or late changes, or by both. 
 We observed no significant effects of time on average activation in any value-related regions. However, we did observe significant  increases  over time in other regions not related to value, including a region of ventrolateral prefrontal cortex associated with regulation (see the section on “Neural systems implementing cognitive regulation” below). 
 Finally, we asked whether the magnitude of changes in the average BOLD response correlated across subjects with regulatory success (the average decrease in bids during DISTANCE and increase in bids during INDULGE when compared to NATURAL bids). However, we did not find any such correlation for any region, either when using activity measures for the full trial or for the late phase only (all  P  > .11). 
 These results suggest that value modulation plays a modest role in this task. They also suggest that vmPFC activity was more easily and quickly up-regulated, while dlPFC activity may be more easily and quickly down-regulated. 
 
 
 Tests of Behavioral Control Modulation 
 Behavioral control modulation predicts changes in the relative influence of a region's computations on behavioral outcomes. This can be tested using the previous GLMs by asking if cognitive regulation modifies the correlation between bids and BOLD responses in vmPFC or dlPFC, either for activity over the whole evaluation period, or differentially as a function of time. 
 Using GLM-1, we looked for differences in the correlates of bid in DISTANCE or INDULGE compared to NATURAL over the entire evaluation period, using bid responses in each condition as parametric modulators. We found no significant effects at our omnibus threshold. 
 We then used GLM-2 to test for differences that emerged over time. We began by assessing NATURAL trials alone for significant time-dependent changes in correlation with bid (i.e. changes in effects of the bid parametric modulator). No regions exhibited this pattern at our omnibus threshold. We then estimated the strength of the 2 (Condition: DISTANCE vs. NATURAL, INDULGE vs. NATURAL, or INDULGE vs. DISTANCE) × 2 (Time: Late vs. Early) interaction on correlates of bid (parametric modulation). Within regions showing significant interactions with time ( Table 4 ,  Late vs. Early period ), we decomposed the same comparison into effects at the early or late time-points only ( Table 4 ,  Early period only ,  Late period only ). 
 Cognitive regulation had a striking and significant time-dependent effect on the correlates of bid ( Figure 3A-C ;  Table 4 ,  Late vs. Early period ). A linear contrast of the three conditions (DISTANCE = −1, NATURAL = 0, IND = +1) showed a significant positive interaction (i.e., increased association with bid over time) in vmPFC ( P  < .001, SVC and  P  = .01, WBC;  Figure 3A ), and a significant negative interaction (i.e., decreased association with bid over time) in right dlPFC ( Fig. 3B ;  P  = .001 SVC,  P  = .001 WBC), left dlPFC ( Fig. 3C ;  P  = .001, uncorrected,  P  = .09 SVC), and right inferior parietal cortex ( P = . 001, WBC). Interaction analyses for DISTANCE vs. NATURAL and INDULGE vs. NATURAL separately largely identified the same areas (see  Table 4  for details). 
 To better understand these interactions, we performed ROI analyses to decompose them into the following components: the change in correlation with bid in DISTANCE vs. NATURAL separately at the early and late time points, and the change in correlation with bid in INDULGE vs. NATURAL separately at the early and late time points. For simplicity, we focus in the text on analysis of regions identified by the contrast of INDULGE vs. DISTANCE, because they mostly encompassed areas identified in each regulation condition separately.  Table 4  reports the results for all regions. 
 We found that vmPFC showed both a late-period decrease in the correlation with bid in the contrast of DISTANCE − NATURAL trials ( P  = .02), as well as an early-period decrease in correlation with bid in the contrast of INDULGE − NATURAL trials ( P  = .04). Dorsolateral and parietal areas exhibited the reverse pattern. In the contrast of DISTANCE − NATURAL bids, their association with bids was lower early in the trial (range  P  = .07-.001), and increased by late in the trial (range  P  = .06-.02), while in the contrast of INDULGE - NATURAL bids, their association was not strongly different at the early period (all  P  > .06) and robustly decreased by late in the trial (all  P  < .02). Separate analyses controlling for reaction time yielded nearly identical results to all analyses reported above, suggesting that these results were not driven merely by differences in response time. 
 We carried out two additional post-hoc analyses to further explore these results. First, we plotted the association between bids and BOLD activity in the vmPFC and dlPFC regions-of-interest as it evolved over the trial. In NATURAL trials, bids correlated with vmPFC activity beginning almost immediately after food onset, and continued to do so up until bid placement. In contrast, in DISTANCE trials the correlation was significant only during the early phase, and in INDULGE trials only during the late phase ( Fig. 3D ). Bilateral dlPFC exhibited the opposite pattern (shown for left and right dlPFC in  Fig. 3E-F ). 
 We also tested for a correlation between regulatory success (as measured by the change in average bid) and the extent to which bid-BOLD correlations in valuation areas differed during either the early evaluation phase or the late response initiation phase. Note that such a shift in mean bids could result from changes in brain-behavior correlations if regions where average activation is high or unchanged (i.e. vmPFC) are prevented from driving behavior during DISTANCE, and regions where activation is low (i.e. dlPFC) are prevented from driving behavior during INDULGE. This predicts that greater vmPFC control during INDULGE trials (when vmPFC activation increased more than dlPFC) should be associated with higher bids, and that greater dlPFC control during DISTANCE trials (when dlPFC activation decreased more than vmPFC), should be associated with lower bids. 
 We found no correlation between regulatory success and changes during the early evaluation phase in vmPFC, dlPFC, or inferior parietal cortex association with bids. However, we found significant correlations at the late response initiation phase. Consistent with behavioral control modulation, the less vmPFC correlated with bids in DISTANCE trials, the less people bid ( r  = −.4,  P  = .04,  Fig. 4A ), while the  more  vmPFC activity correlated with bids in INDULGE trials, the  more  they bid ( r  = +.45,  P  = .02,  Fig. 4B ). In DISTANCE trials we also found a significant correlation between the extent to which left dlPFC correlated with the bids and regulatory success ( r  = .46,  P  = .02,  Fig. 4C ), although the analogous result for INDULGE trials was not significant ( Fig. 4D ). Right dlPFC and parietal responses did not correlate with regulatory success. 
 Together, these analyses provide evidence for control modulation during decision-making in our cognitive regulation task, and suggest that the vmPFC and dlPFC may make parallel but distinct contributions to value. When participants  decreased  their desire for food, vmPFC response to the food predicted the bid  less , while dlPFC response predicted it  more . When participants  increased  their desire for food, vmPFC response continued to predict bids, while dlPFC response predicted bids  less . In addition, these shifts predicted regulatory success. 
 
 
 Neural Systems Implementing Cognitive Regulation 
 We next sought to identify regions likely to play a role in producing the changes in value-related regions during cognitive regulation. Using GLM-1, we searched for areas exhibiting stronger average activity in DISTANCE or INDULGE vs. NATURAL trials, over the full time period. We found stronger activity in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) for both regulation conditions separately, compared to NATURAL trials ( Fig 5A,B ;  P  < .05, WBC;  Table 2 ). A conjunction analysis confirmed that vlPFC bilaterally, as well as left PPC, responded positively during both conditions ( Fig 5C ). Comparing the two regulation conditions to each other revealed no differences in these regions. 
 Time courses of activation in vlPFC and PPC suggested somewhat different patterns of response in these two regions ( Fig 5C ). Activity in vlPFC gradually increased above baseline during DISTANCE trials and peaked near the end of the evaluation period, with a similar but smaller increase in INDULGE trials ( Fig 5C , right). In the PPC, response during DISTANCE and INDULGE trials did not change from baseline. Instead, NATURAL trials showed a pronounced deactivation not present in regulation trials ( Fig 5C , left). 
 Finally, we tested the hypothesis that vlPFC and PPC play a role in cognitive regulation by modulating value computations in dlPFC and vmPFC. We estimated psychophysiological interaction models that allowed us to compare functional connectivity of these areas in the different conditions. We found that left vlPFC was significantly more negatively coupled with vmPFC (but not dlPFC) in DISTANCE compared to NATURAL trials (110 voxels, negative peak at 0, 45, 0,  P  = .001, SVC), but did not differ in connectivity on INDULGE trials. In addition, although changes in PPC connectivity did not meet our omnibus significance threshold for either dlPFC or vmPFC, at a slightly more liberal threshold (p < .005, uncorrected), the left PPC was more  positively  coupled with both left (53 voxels, peak at −48, 39, 24) and right dlPFC (19 voxels, peak at 51, 30, 33) on DISTANCE trials, and more  negatively  coupled with right dlPFC on INDULGE trials (33 voxels, negative peak at 27, 48, 42). 
 Given these effects, we also sought to determine whether vlPFC or PPC responses were correlated with either behavioral measures of regulatory success or with the changes in neural response that we observed in vmPFC and dlPFC. However, these analyses revealed no significant correlations. 
 
 
 
 Discussion 
 Our experiment provides novel insights into the computational and neurobiological mechanisms of cognitive regulation during decision-making. We identified areas of both vmPFC and dlPFC where activity correlated with values expressed in behavior. We then examined how cognitive regulation affected these regions. We tested and found evidence for two distinct regulatory mechanisms: value modulation (changing the values assigned to stimuli) and behavioral control modulation (changing how value signals affect behavior). However, dlPFC and vmPFC were differentially sensitive to value-modulation: attempts to distance more effectively down-regulated dlPFC signals, while attempts to indulge more effectively up-regulated vmPFC signals. Behavioral control modulation also affected these regions differentially: the vmPFC contribution to behavior decreased over time to near-zero in DISTANCE trials, while dlPFC contribution increased. The opposite pattern emerged in INDULGE trials. Moreover, whereas value modulation effects were consistent over time, behavioral control modulation effects varied considerably, and correlated with regulatory success only late in the trial. Finally, the pattern of vlPFC and PPC activity suggests that they play a role in coordinating the regulation-related changes in value regions: vlPFC and PPC responded more strongly during both regulatory conditions, and changes in their connectivity with vmPFC and dlPFC corresponded to changes in each value region's correlation with behavior. These results have implications for several domains. 
 
 Value Construction: Single vs. Multiple Value Systems 
 Studies of choice in the absence of explicit regulation point to the importance of both vmPFC and dlPFC in the computation of value at the time of choice ( Kable and Glimcher, 2007 ;  Plassmann et al., 2007 ;  Kim et al., 2008 ;  Basten et al., 2010 ;  Plassmann et al., 2010 ;  Sokol-Hessner et al., 2012 ), but their relative roles are unclear. Some have argued that they compute parallel but distinct values, with vmPFC placing more weight on immediate, concrete outcomes (e.g., taste), and dlPFC placing more weight on long-term, abstract goals (e.g., healthiness). In this view, the quality of decisions depends on the relative weight given to the two value signals in behavior ( McClure et al., 2004 ). Others have proposed that a single value system (usually associated with vmPFC) integrates information about all stimulus attributes, including health and taste, and then determines choice ( Kable and Glimcher, 2007 ;  Hare et al., 2009 ). In this view, decisions depend on how vmPFC value computations weight different stimulus attributes, with that weighting modulated by the dlPFC. 
 Our results inform this debate. First, vmPFC and dlPFC signals both correlated with behaviorally expressed values, suggesting that they both contribute to choice. Second, cognitive regulation more effectively decreased dlPFC activity, but more effectively  increased  vmPFC activity, consistent with the hypothesis that these regions represent different types of information. Third, cognitive regulation changed the relative impact that dlPFC and vmPFC had on choices. For example, when subjects tried to decrease craving, dlPFC activity showed greater correlation with behavior than vmPFC activity. Taken together, these findings suggest that, in our task, vmPFC and dlPFC participate in the computation of value signals with different properties. Moreover, the influence of these two signals on behavior can be dynamically adjusted according to the current goal. 
 
 
 Value Construction: Differences in vmPFC vs. dlPFC Value-Related Activity 
 Our results do not speak directly to the computations instantiated by vmPFC and dlPFC in this context, but together with other findings in the literature, they provide some clues. Our finding that vmPFC and dlPFC seem differentially sensitive to attempts to increase and decrease desire, respectively, suggests that these regions may weight basic and abstract attributes (e.g., taste vs. health) differently. Consistent with this, an area of dlPFC close to that identified here correlated with health ratings in a study involving instructions to attend to longer-term health consequences of choice ( Hare et al., 2011a ). 
 However, other data are less consistent with this hypothesis. The dlPFC does not correlate with value consistently ( Hare et al., 2008 ;  Chib et al., 2009 ;  Litt et al., 2011 ) nor have all studies of self-control found that dlPFC correlates specifically with the value of abstract attributes ( Kable and Glimcher, 2007 ;  Hare et al., 2009 ). We speculate that differences in the attentional requirements of the task or the relative flexibility of the dlPFC compared to vmPFC in representing different quantities may underlie these inconsistencies, but further evidence will be needed to bear this out. 
 
 
 Value Construction: Differential Integration of Value Signals Over Time 
 Our results show that the relative influence of vmPFC and dlPFC value-related areas changes over time, particularly towards the end of the 4 second decision period. This result is consistent with models that assume the brain makes choices using a value integration and comparison process that unfolds over time ( Bogacz et al., 2006 ;  Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008 ;  Basten et al., 2010 ;  Milosavljevic et al., 2010 ;  Hare et al., 2011b ). In these models, valuation areas compute signals that feed into an action selection network, activating different responses until activation for one response accumulates strongly enough to cross a threshold and initiate choice. Importantly, these models suggest that both early- and late-occurring evidence can affect the comparator process and choice ( Resulaj et al., 2009 ). Our results suggest that cognitive regulation can affect both evidence quality (via value modulation) and its ability to drive action selection (via behavioral control modulation). 
 
 
 Self-control: Multiple Contexts, Multiple Mechanisms 
 Our results present a puzzle: Why do we observe evidence for multiple value signals and behavioral control modulation in this task, but previous self-control studies have not ( Kable and Glimcher, 2007 ;  Hare et al., 2009 )? For example, some have ( Hare et al., 2009 ;  Hare et al., 2011a ) found that a single stimulus value signal, encoded in vmPFC, correlated with behavior regardless of whether subjects displayed successful self-control. However, in good dieters vmPFC reflected both health and taste, but in bad dieters it reflected only taste. Moreover, in good dieters areas of dlPFC (more posterior and dorsal than those identified here) came on-line and modulated vmPFC value representations. 
 Our study alone cannot resolve why these two studies differ so dramatically. We conjecture that the answer may lie in the  type  of self-control utilized. We explicitly instructed participants to do whatever necessary to modulate their craving over a four second period. Although this instruction could have encouraged different approaches in different people, and thus resulted in little consistency, we observed significant changes in neural responding that suggest at least some common processes across subjects, including changes in behavioral control modulation. 
 In contrast to our study, previous studies have not explicitly asked participants to regulate, but simply to make choices consistent with their own habits and goals. Concomitantly, responses in these studies take less time (under two seconds) than many regulation effects we observed (four seconds or more). We suspect that subjects used to making healthy choices (i.e. dieters) might modulate the vmPFC directly using quicker self-control mechanisms. Those unaccustomed to making healthy choices (i.e. our participants) might rely on slower, more deliberative, mechanisms that operate through different means (e.g., behavioral control). These differences may explain differences in the areas of lateral PFC activated by these two tasks, and in the speed with which self-control arises. 
 
 
 Self-control: Decision-making Versus Emotion Regulation 
 The observation that some regions of dlPFC may play a role in valuation could also explain another puzzling aspect of our results: research in emotion regulation typically finds  increases  in dlPFC ( Ochsner and Gross, 2005 ), whereas we found  decreases . Yet most emotional regulation paradigms involve  decreasing  response to a negative stimulus. If dlPFC correlates positively with value, then reducing negative affect should increase activation in this region. Indeed, some studies  have  found decreases in similar locations of dlPFC during down-regulation of positive affect ( Kober et al., 2010 ), although these results were not highlighted. However, others find  increases  in more anterior regions of dlPFC when  increasing  negative emotion (e.g.,  Kim and Hamann, 2007 ). This suggests that the dlPFC may be a functionally heterogenous area, or may compute different signals in different contexts. We suspect that the notion that the dlPFC serves always simply to regulate affective representations in other brain areas is likely incorrect. 
 In contrast, the vlPFC and PPC areas we identified with cognitive regulation of decision-making overlap considerably with those found during cognitive regulation of emotional experience ( Ochsner et al., 2004 ;  Wager et al., 2008 ), and are thought to play important roles in attentional and cognitive control ( Badre et al., 2005 ;  Badre and Wagner, 2005 ;  Decety and Lamm, 2007 ). Future research should compare the roles of vlPFC and PCC in cognitive regulation of emotion vs. decision-making, to determine if they implement a constant set of computations, or exhibit differences across domains. 
 
 
 Self-control: Difficulty of Regulation 
 Our finding that regulation effects evolve over time may explain why it often feels so difficult. If early signals in vmPFC contribute to bids but are unaffected by attempts to decrease craving, then changes to value computations in dlPFC have to overcome these early signals. Similarly, if the dlPFC responds to less arousing features when attempting to increase desire, vmPFC responses, even if increased quickly, have to counteract them. Co-activation of competing value signals during decision-making may determine when regulation feels difficult.

 Experimental procedure and behavioral results. A) Structure and timing of an experimental trial. B) Average bids for each condition. Error bars show standard error of the mean (s.e.m.) 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 2 
 
 Evidence for value modulation during the full evaluation period. A) vmPFC and B) right dlPFC regions that correlated with bids during NATURAL trials, and (from left to right) changes in activation in these regions in DISTANCE − NATURAL trials, INDULGE − NATURAL trials, and INDULGE − DISTANCE trials. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 3 
 
 Evidence for behavioral control modulation that varies as a function of time during cognitive regulation. A) vmPFC, B) left dlPFC and C) right dlPFC regions in which a linear contrast of correlation with behavior in each condition (DISTANCE = −1, NATURAL = 0, INDULGE = +1) showed a significant interaction with time (early evaluation vs. late response initiation). Hot colors indicate greater correlation with behavior in INDULGE compared to DISTANCE. Cool colors indicate the opposite. D-F) Time course of activation in each condition (blue = DISTANCE, green = NATURAL, yellow = INDULGE). Parameter estimates indicate the average strength of association with bid at each time point, and encompass a 20 s window beginning at onset of instruction (see Methods for details). Dashed vertical lines demarcate trial events, and are shifted forward 5 s to account for hemodynamic lag. Horizontal double lines at the top of the plots indicate time points at which two conditions differ (p < .05). Line colors indicate the conditions being compared. Transparent areas indicate s.e.m. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 4 
 
 Correlation between individual differences in regulatory success and differences in correlation with bid at the end of the choice period for A) vmPFC in DISTANCE − NATURAL trials, B) vmPFC in INDULGE − NATURAL trials, C) left dlPFC in DISTANCE − NATURAL trials, D) left dlPFC in INDULGE − NATURAL trials. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 5 
 
 Regions implementing cognitive regulation. Regions more activated during A) DISTANCE − NATURAL trials, and B) INDULGE − NATURAL trials. C) Overlap between DISTANCE (blue) and INDULGE (red) in left vlPFC and PPC. Time courses of BOLD activation are displayed for left PPC (right) and left vlPFC (left). See Methods for details.
