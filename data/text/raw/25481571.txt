 The aim of the study was to examine functional brain activity in response
to unpleasant images in individuals with the 7-repeat (7R) allele compared to
individuals with the 4-repeat (4R) allele of the dopamine receptor D4
( DRD4 ) gene (VNTR in exon 3). Based on the response ready
hypothesis, individuals with the  DRD4 -4R/7R genotype were
expected to show greater functional brain activity in response to unpleasant
compared to neutral stimuli in specific regions of the frontal, temporal,
parietal and limbic lobes, which form the networks involved in attentional,
emotional, and preparatory responses. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
activity was studied in 26 young adults (13 with the  DRD4 -4R/7R
genotype and 13 with the  DRD4 -4R/4R genotype). Participants
were asked to look at and subjectively rate unpleasant and neutral images.
Results showed increased brain activity in response to unpleasant images
compared to neutral images in the right temporal lobe in participants with the
 DRD4 -4R/7R genotype versus participants with the
 DRD4 -4R/4R genotype. The increase in right temporal lobe
activity in individuals with  DRD4 -4R/7R suggests greater
involvement in processing negative emotional stimuli. Intriguingly, no
differences were found between the two genotypes in the subjective ratings of
the images. The findings corroborate the response ready hypothesis, which
suggests that individuals with the 7R allele are more responsive to negative
emotional stimuli compared to individuals with the 4R allele of the
 DRD4  gene.

 1. Introduction 
 Dopamine is a key neurotransmitter, which regulates cognition, attention,
emotional processing, motor activation, short-term memory, behavioral inhibition and
reward ( Wickens, 1990 ;  Nieoullon, 2002 ;  Dreber et al.,
2009 ;  Eisenberg et al., 2010b ).
One of the most studied genes is the dopamine receptor D4 ( DRD4 ),
which is located near the telomere of chromosome 11p. The  DRD4  gene
has alleles due to variation in a 48 base pair tandem repeat (VNTR) in exon 3. The
48 base pair VNTR in exon 3 ranges from 2- repeat alleles (2R) to 11-repeat alleles
(11R). The 4-repeat (4R) of the  DRD4  gene is the most common allele
with a global mean allele frequency of 64.3% ( Chang et al., 1996 ). The 7-repeat (7R) of the  DRD4  gene
is the second most common allele with a global mean allele frequency of
20.6%, appearing with high frequency in the Americas ( Chang et al., 1996 ). The 7R allele originated as a rare
mutational event and was recently affected by positive selection ( Ding et al., 2002 ). The 7R allele is estimated
to have emerged 40,000 to 50,000 years ago, which is the same time that major human
migration occurred ( Wang et al., 2004 ). This
genotype, including its homozygous and heterozygous variations, is found more
frequently in populations who had to take great risks to travel long distances, such
as early immigrants to the Americas ( Chen et al.,
1999 ;  Eisenberg et al., 2010a ).
The association with risk taking was corroborated by research showing that
individuals with the 7R allele of the  DRD4  gene engage in more
financial risk taking compared to those without this genotype ( Dreber et al., 2009 ). 
 Humans with at least one 7R allele show increased levels of physical activity
( Faraone et al., 2001 ;  Kluger et al., 2002 ;  Grady et al., 2003 ;  Grady et
al., 2005b ;  Li et al., 2006 ;  Grady et al., 2013 ) and appear to be more
reactive to environmental factors ( Sheese at al.,
2007 ;  Belsky et al., 2009 ;  Olsson et al., 2011 ;  Grady et al., 2013 ). The 7R allele is over-represented in the
phenotype of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) ( LaHoste et al., 1996 ;  Faraone
et al., 2001 ;  Grady et al., 2003 ;
 Grady et al., 2005a ;  Li et al., 2006 ). In addition, the 7R allele is
associated with problematic behaviors including: alcoholism ( MacKillop et al., 2007 ), financial risk-taking ( Dreber et al., 2009 ), disinhibition ( Congdon et al., 2008 ), increased sexual
behavior, and infidelity ( Zion et al., 2006 ;
 Eisenberg et al., 2007 ;  Garcia et al., 2010 ). However, 7R carriers have
an advantage in some tests of reaction time ( Swanson
et al., 2000a ;  Langley et al.,
2004 ) and executive function ( Swanson et
al., 2000b ;  Gornick et al., 2007 ;
 Johnson et al., 2008 ), though these
results have not been consistently replicated ( Barkley et al., 2006 ;  Konrad et al.,
2010 ). Intriguingly, a study by  Grady et
al. (2013)  has shown that the 7R allele contributes to longevity by
moderating the beneficial effects of an enriched environment in increasing lifespan.
The 7R allele of the  DRD4  gene has been associated with the
response ready hypothesis, which suggests that individuals with hypervigilance might
be selected for by environments that are resource-depleted, time critical, or
rapidly changing ( Jensen et al., 1997 ;  Wang et al., 2004 ). It is speculated that the
7R allele and its association with the response ready hypothesis might have played a
role in its positive selection and human migration ( Chen et al., 1999 ;  Ding et al.,
2002 ;  Wang et al., 2004 ;  Grady et al., 2013 ). 
 The  DRD4  receptor protein is expressed in several brain
regions, with high levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), middle temporal lobe, and
limbic areas, i.e. hippocampus, amygdala, and hypothalamus ( O’Malley et al., 1992 ;  Meador-Woodruff et al., 1994 ;  Oak et
al., 2000 ). The human attentional network utilizes the superior parietal,
inferior parietal, and superior temporal lobes for the orienting response, anterior
cingulate for executive functioning, and lateral PFC for control ( Fan and Posner, 2004 ). Previous research has
shown that processing of negative emotional stimuli involves the inferior frontal
gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus ( Davidson and Irwin, 1999 ), right temporal lobe ( Aldhafeeri et al., 2012 ), precuneus, inferior parietal lobules
( Ferri et al., 2013 ), hippocampus,
parahippocampus, and amygdala ( Davidson and Irwin,
1999 ;  Nolte, 2002 ;  Aldhafeeri et al., 2012 ). In addition, the
medial, dorsolateral, and ventrolateral PFC are involved in the appraisal process of
emotional stimuli ( Hariri et al., 2000 ;  Goldin et al., 2008 ;  Rosen and Levenson, 2009 ). 
 The aim of this study was to examine functional brain activity in response to
unpleasant and neutral images in individuals with and without the 7R allele of the
 DRD4  gene. Based on the response ready hypothesis, we expected
that individuals with a 7R allele would show increased brain activity compared to
those without a 7R allele in response to unpleasant stimuli in the bilateral PFC
(inferior, middle, and superior frontal gyri), limbic areas (hippocampus,
parahippocampus, and amygdala), parietal lobe (inferior parietal lobule and superior
parietal lobule), and the right temporal lobe, which are involved in attention,
processing of sensory information, and emotions. 
 
 
 2. Methods 
 
 2.1 Participants 
 Twenty-six participants were recruited from the Multimodal Treatment
Study of ADHD (MTA) at the University of California, Irvine (UCI). The MTA
sample at UCI originally consisted of 144 children (96 with ADHD and 48
normative comparison children) who were seven to nine years old when they first
enrolled in 1994 to 1996. After the treatment portion of the MTA study ended,
the participants were followed on a regular basis for 16 years. At the time of
the present study, there were 68 participants with a diagnosis of ADHD and 41
normative comparison participants (a total of 109) that were still participating
in the follow-up protocols. The MTA sample was well-defined in terms of mental
health status and dopamine genotypes were available for 86 participants ( Swanson et al., 2000a ). All 86 young adults
were contacted regarding participation in the study. Forty participants were
consented for the present study of which 13 had a heterozygous 7R allele
(4R/7R). Participants with the  DRD4 -4R/7R genotype were age and
gender matched with 13 participants with the  DRD4 -4R/4R
genotype because the  DRD4 -4R/4R is the more common genotype.
Eleven participants with the  DRD4 -4R/7R genotype and seven
participants with the  DRD4 -4R/4R genotype had a childhood
diagnosis of ADHD. All participants abstained from drugs and alcohol use before
the functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scan, which was verified with
urinary and breath drug screens.  Table 1 
provides an overview of the participants’ characteristics. 
 
 
 2.2 Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) 
 Each participant underwent one fMRI scan at the Center for Functional
Onco-Imaging, which is equipped with a 3.0T Philips Achieva scanner and MRI
compatible visual display, auditory stimuli, and response device systems.
Structural and functional MRI acquisition, quality control, and calibration
methods developed by the Center were utilized for the proposed experiments. 
 The MRI operator ran quality assurance tests daily at the beginning of
the day. Each session started with a high resolution (1 mm isotropic voxel size)
T1 weighted anatomic scan using 3D MPRAGE pulse sequence with the following
parameters: TR/TE = 11/3.3 ms, TI = 1100 ms, TFE = 192, number of slices = 150,
SENSE factor = none, Flip angle = 180°, no SENSE acceleration was used
and total acquisition duration was 7 minutes. For fMRI scans conventional
T2*-weighted gradient echo planar sequences (GE-EPI) were used, with TR/TE =
2500 ms/30 ms, flip angle 90°. Fat-saturation prepulses were included to
avoid fat signal overlapping the brain pixels. Slices were in the oblique-axial
plane parallel with the AC-PC plane, with 4 mm thickness, and a 1 mm inter-slice
gap, and acquired in ascending order. The acquisition matrix was 96×80,
not interpolated, with 220 mm FOV. Typically, whole-brain coverage was achieved
with 32 slices. The MRI acquisition was sequential. Responses to the task during
scanning were monitored using a 4-button keypad (Current Designs, INC,
Philadelphia, PA), and reaction times were recorded for subsequent
psychophysical analysis of timing and accuracy of task performance. All stimuli
were presented and responses recorded using Cogent 2000 software environment
(Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, UK). Head movement in the scanner
was restrained by vacuum pillows and tape across the subject’s forehead.
A precautionary screening was used to exclude participants who may have
contraindications to MRI. 
 
 
 2.3 Emotional stimuli 
 Participants were asked to look at unpleasant images (e.g., images of
negative emotional faces, physical injuries, and insects) and neutral images
(e.g., images of neutral faces, landscapes and household items) from the
International Affective Picture System (IAPS) ( Lang et al., 2008 ) during the scan. More specifically, participants
were asked to look at 24 neutral and 24 unpleasant images 1 , which were presented in 8 blocks
of 3 neutral images followed by 3 unpleasant images. Each image was presented
for 5 seconds and was rated within those 5 seconds by participants according to
neutrality and unpleasantness. The participants used a keypad with 4 buttons to
indicate their rating on a scale from 1 (neutral) to 4 (extremely unpleasant).
There were no rest periods between images during these relatively brief
sessions. Prior to the scan, participants were familiarized with sample images
from the IAPS without labeling or rating them. 
 
 
 2.4 Image processing 
 Brain images were processed and analyzed with the Statistical Parametric
Mapping software, SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, UK) in
MATLAB 7.9 (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). Six motion parameters (three rotational
and three translational) were used for image realignment and motion correction.
Brain volume images with more than 2 mm displacement or 2° rotation were
excluded. As a result, 13 out of 240 brain volumes were excluded from one male
participant with the  DRD4 -4R/4R genotype. All images were
motion corrected by realignment to the first image, co-registration with the
anatomical scan, normalized using the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)
brain template, and spatially smoothed with an isotropic 5 mm
full-width-half-maximum Gaussian kernel. 
 A first-level general linear model analysis (GLM) was used to generate
Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) contrasts between unpleasant and neutral
images for each participant at  p  = 0.001 and a voxel threshold
of 20. A second-level analysis used the contrast images from the first-level GLM
analyses in an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare BOLD contrasts of brain
activation during unpleasant versus neutral images between the two genotypes at
 p  ≤ 0.05 (False Discovery Rate-corrected) and a
voxel threshold of 20. 
 To provide additional information about brain activation patterns in
response to unpleasant compared to neutral images for each genotype, BOLD
contrasts from the first-level GLM analyses were examined with a second-level
random effects model analysis at  p  = 0.001 (uncorrected) and a
voxel threshold of 20. Clusters were identified by SPM8 and translated into
Talairach space with Brett transformations using the MNI-Talairach Viewer (UCI -
Institute for Clinical and Translational Science). 
 
 
 2.5 Genotyping 
 DNA isolation from blood samples and genotyping/sequencing of the
 DRD4  VNTR was conducted as described previously ( Ding et al., 2002 ;  Grady et al., 2003 ;  Wang et
al., 2004 ;  Grady et al.,
2013 ). 
 All experiments were carried out in accordance with the Institutional
Review Board at the University of California, Irvine, and were consistent with
Federal Guidelines. 
 
 
 
 3. Results 
 
 3.1 Emotional ratings 
 A significant main effect revealed that unpleasant images were rated
significantly more unpleasant than neutral images ( M  = 2.72,
 S.D.  = 0.69 versus  M  = 1.19,
 S.D.  = 0.24,  F (1,24) = 148.25,
 p  < 0.001). No group differences were found in the
image ratings between the two genotypes (see  Table 1 ). Therefore, the choice of stimuli was appropriate and
confirmed by this main effect. 
 
 
 3.2 fMRI group differences 
 Individuals with the  DRD4 -4R/7R genotype, compared to
the  DRD4 -4R/4R genotype, showed significant increased BOLD
activity in the right temporal lobe in response to unpleasant versus neutral
images (see  Fig. 1 ,  Table 2 ). 
 
 
 3.3 fMRI activity in the DRD4-4R/7R genotype 
 Participants with the  DRD4 -4R/7R genotype showed
increased BOLD activity in response to unpleasant images compared to neutral
images in the right superior frontal gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, right
middle temporal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus, left posterior cingulate,
right cingulate, right precuneus, left cuneus, and the bilateral inferior
parietal lobules, which are involved in paying attention, showing empathy, and
preparing for action (see  Fig. 2 ,  Table 3 ). 
 
 
 3.4 fMRI activity in the DRD4-4R/4R genotype 
 Participants with the  DRD4 -4R/4R genotype showed
increased BOLD activity in response to unpleasant images compared to neutral
images, which was limited to the precuneus and cingulate gyrus in the right
parietal lobe (see  Fig. 2 ,  Table 4 ). 
 
 
 
 4. Discussion 
 The findings corroborate the response ready hypothesis for the
 DRD4 -4R/7R genotype at the neurobehavioral level. Individuals
with the  DRD4 -4R/7R genotype showed significantly more right
temporal lobe activity while viewing unpleasant images compared to those with the
 DRD4 -4R/4R genotype. The right temporal lobe is primarily
associated with processing of sensory and emotional information ( Rosen et al., 2002 ;  Aldhafeeri et al., 2012 ). Thus, the greater activation of the
right temporal lobe suggests a greater involvement in processing emotional stimuli
in individuals with the  DRD4 -4R/7R compared to those with the
 DRD4 -4R/4R genotype. 
 Additional findings for each genotype revealed that individuals with the
 DRD4 -4R/7R genotype showed increased brain activity in a
complex network including the frontal, temporal, limbic, and parietal lobes when
viewing unpleasant compared to neutral images. More specifically, participants with
the  DRD4 -4R/7R genotype showed activation in the parietal cortex,
cingulate, and PFC ( Fan and Posner, 2004 ),
which are associated with attention to and appraisal of emotional stimuli ( Hariri et al., 2000 ;  Goldin et al., 2008 ;  Rosen and
Levenson, 2009 ). As expected, both  DRD4 -4R/7R and
 DRD4 -4R/4R genotypes were associated with activation of
inferior parietal regions, which are involved in passive observation ( Cunnington et al., 2006 ), but only participants
with the 7R allele showed activation of DLPFC (Brodmann areas 8, 10, and 46), which
reflects attention and preparation for action ( Cunnington et al., 2006 ;  Herwig et al.,
2007 ). In addition, the activation of frontal and temporal regions in
participants with the 7R allele indicates that the stimuli were perceived as
meaningful ( Decety et al., 1997 ).
Furthermore, those with the 7R allele showed activation in the right middle temporal
gyrus and right cingulate gyrus, which have been associated with empathy during
perception of unpleasant or painful stimuli in others ( Gu et al., 2010 ;  Lang et al.,
2011 ;  Azevedo et al., 2012 ). In
contrast, participants with the  DRD4 -4R/4R genotype showed brain
activation in response to unpleasant compared to neutral images, which was limited
to the cingulate gyrus and precuneus in the right parietal lobe without involvement
of limbic, frontal or temporal brain areas, suggesting a more passive processing of
information. 
 Intriguingly, participants with the  DRD4 -4R/4R genotype
rated unpleasant stimuli as unpleasant as those with the  DRD4 -4R/7R
genotype although their brain activation pattern indicates less of a response. Thus,
the two groups differ in their right temporal brain activity but not in their
self-reported emotion. This suggests a mismatch between brain activity and
subjective emotional experience. Participants with the  DRD4 -4R/4R
genotype may be over-reporting their emotional experience or participants with the
 DRD4 -4R/7R may be under-reporting their emotional
experience. 
 Taken together, participants with the 7R allele showed a more global and
intense activation pattern in response to unpleasant images, which may be indicating
increased attention, showing empathy, and preparing for action during unpleasant
stimuli. Given higher propensity for risk taking with the 7R allele of the
 DRD4  gene, the results support the notion that part of risk
taking is an appropriate risk assessment that includes paying close attention to
unpleasant or threatening stimuli. Furthermore, risky decision-making behaviors have
been associated with activation in regions of the temporal lobe including the
temporoparietal junction, temporal pole, and the middle and superior temporal gyri
( Rodrigo et al., 2014 ). 
 However, there are some limitations that require interpreting the findings
of the present study with caution. Although not unusual for brain imaging studies,
the present study had a small sample size, which may have compromised statistical
power, replicability, and stability of the findings. Since pleasant stimuli were not
included in this study, it is not possible to determine whether the increased brain
activations reflect response readiness rather than an overwhelmed brain experiencing
overload from unpleasant stimuli. Similarly, the present findings cannot distinguish
between appraisal and response processes. In addition, risk-taking, attention, and
empathy measures were not administered, so that the link between brain activity and
risky behaviors, attention and empathy was not directly examined. However, by only
investigating  DRD4- 4R homozygous individuals in comparison to
 DRD4 -7R heterozygous individuals, genetic heterogeneity was
minimized and our ability to detect differences in brain activity was potentially
maximized. Clearly, further studies are warranted. 
 Despite these limitations, the present findings contribute to the concept of
the  DRD4 -4R/7R genotype as a "plasticity gene" ( Belsky et al., 2009 ).  Grady et al. (2013)  proposed that the 7R allele of the
 DRD4  gene may mediate reactivity to environmental stimuli via a
dopamine signaling deficit. The present study corroborates this hypothesis by
showing that individuals with the  DRD4 -4R/7R genotype are less
likely to ignore negative emotional stimuli. Such mechanisms underlying the 7R
allele of the  DRD4  gene associated with a response ready hypothesis
( Jensen et al., 1997 ) may have played a
role in its positive selection and human migration ( Chen et al., 1999 ;  Ding et al.,
2002 ;  Wang et al., 2004 ;  Grady et al., 2013 ). 
 Forty thousand to 50,000 years ago, humans may have encountered conditions
leading to large migrations. Migration into new territories requires a mindset that
is dominated by both risk-taking and appropriate response readiness to increase
survival.  Ding et al. (2002)  found that the
7R allele of the  DRD4  gene is under positive selective pressure,
which raises questions about its adaptability to modern culture. According to  Sheese et al. (2007)  the 7R allele is
associated with a greater influence of parenting, which allows the caregiver more
influence on the behavior of the child and increases the child’s adaptation
to the social environment. The 7R allele may predispose an individual to be more
reactive to the environment, hence faster reaction times ( Swanson et al., 2000a ) and negative behavioral outcomes in an
unfavorable environment ( Sheese et al., 2007 ;
 Olsson et al., 2011 ). In particular,
modern industrialized environments may increase the risk for negative behaviors in
individuals with a 7R allele of the  DRD4  gene. Negative behaviors
in response to modern environments in individuals with the 7R allele may include
ADHD and associated conditions such as drug abuse, financial risk taking,
disinhibition, and sexual infidelity ( Zion et al.,
2006 ;  Eisenberg et al., 2007 ;
 MacKillop et al., 2007 ;  Congdon et al., 2008 ;  Dreber et al., 2009 ;  Garcia et
al., 2010 ;  Olsson et al., 2011 ).
Such negative behaviors may be the result of dopamine dysregulation, which is at the
core of ADHD and associated conditions ( Spencer et
al., 2007 ;  Swanson et al., 2007 ;
 Volkow et al., 2009 ;  Volkow et al., 2011 ). 
 Given the documented link between the 7R allele of the  DRD4 
gene and health risk behaviors, future studies should focus on the effects of health
messages (e.g., health warning labels) in this genotype. Within this context, the
results of the present study suggest that individuals with a
 DRD4 -4R/7R genotype might be more responsive to unpleasant visual
health warning labels about risky drug and sexual behaviors compared to individuals
with the more common  DRD4 -4R/4R genotype. Providing health
information and health warning labels in a visual fashion may be a tailored
intervention to prevent and reduce health risk behaviors in individuals with the 7R
allele of the  DRD4  gene.
