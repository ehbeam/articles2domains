 Objectives 
 The neural correlates of human cooperative behavior remain poorly understood. Previous work has suggested that increases in striatal activation while punishing unfair offers represents reward signaling. However, other regions are also implicated when punishing others, for example dorsomedial frontal cortex (dmFC), anterior insula cortex (AIC), and periaqueductal gray (PAG). Moreover, the response of other regions implicated in signaling reward, for example ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) or posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), has not been systematically examined. 
 
 
 Experimental Design 
 Functional magnetic resonance imaging utilizing parametric modulation was conducted on 21 healthy adults participating in a social exchange paradigm. 
 
 
 Principal Observations 
 Participants showed significant positive modulation of activity as a function of delivered punishment in caudate, dmFC, AIC, and PAG; that is, higher punishments by participants of unsatisfactory offers were associated with increasing activity within these regions. However, participants showed significant  negative  modulation of activity as a function of delivered punishment in vmPFC and PCC; increases in punishment level by participants were associated with  decreases  in activity within these regions. 
 
 
 Conclusions 
 The current data question whether caudate activity when punishing unfair offers should be considered to indicate the reward value of this punishment. Instead, this activity, in conjunction with activity within dmFC, AIC, and PAG, may represent the organization of an untypical, punishing response that represents a reactive aggressive response to provocation. Notably, an inverse, regulatory relationship between vmPFC and PAG activity has been previously implicated in the context of another stimulus for reactive aggression; looming threat (Mobbs et al. [2007]: Science 317:1079–1083).

 INTRODUCTION 
 The evolutionary mechanisms underpinning human cooperative behavior have been of interest for some time [ Boyd et al., 2003 ;  Sober and Wilson, 1998 ]. In recent years, a number of investigations on the cognitive neuroscience of cooperation have been conducted using social exchange paradigms [ de Quervain et al., 2004 ;  Rilling et al., 2008 ;  Sanfey et al., 2003 ]. However, the neural processes underlying cooperative behavior are still poorly understood. 
 Social neuroscience work in social exchange paradigms has considered several variants of the Ultimatum Game. In these games, a proposer suggests an allocation of resources and typically the subject decides whether or not to accept this allocation and/or punish the proposer for the unfairness of his offer [ de Quervain et al., 2004 ;  King-Casas et al., 2008 ;  Sanfey et al., 2003 ;  Strobel et al., 2011 ]. As such, the neural response to unfair offers and the neural response when rejecting/punishing unfair offers can be assessed. Receiving unfair offers has been consistently associated with increased activity within anterior insula cortex (AIC) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) [ King-Casas et al., 2008 ;  Rilling et al., 2008 ;  Sanfey et al., 2003 ]. In several of these studies [ de Quervain et al., 2004 ;  Strobel et al., 2011 ;  White et al., 2013 ], choosing to punish unfair offers has been associated with increased activation in striatal regions. It has been suggested that punishing unfair offers is rewarding and that this is the basis of altruistic punishment [ de Quervain et al., 2004 ]. However, other studies have also consistently shown increased activation when deciding to punish unfair offers in regions other than striatum, including AIC and dmPFC and periaqueductal gray (PAG) [ Strobel et al., 2011 ;  White et al., 2013 ]. Moreover, activation in AIC and dmPFC is also seen when the offer is simply rejected (i.e., no punishment is directly occuring;  Corradi-Dell’acqua et al., 2012 ;  Tabibnia et al., 2008 ). It remains unclear, however, if other regions that have been implicated in reward processing, such as ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) [ O’Doherty, 2004 ] and PCC [ Ballard and Knutson, 2009 ;  Levy and Glimcher, 2011 ;  McClure et al., 2007 ], show increased activation in response to punishing unfair offers along with striatal regions. This is particularly important as recent behavioral work suggests that punishing unfairness is  not  motivated by reward. For example, in a series of three experiments, [ Gollwitzer and Bushman 2012 ] demonstrated that mood manipulations, which impacted participant’s representations of mood state following retributive punishment, did not significantly influence the participants’ level of punishment [ Gollwitzer and Bushman, 2012 ]. 
 One thing to note is the overlap between the paradigms that examine social exchange and those used to study human reactive aggression (and associated neural responses). Reactive aggression in humans has primarily been studied using the Taylor Aggression Paradigm (TAP) [ Taylor, 1967 ] and the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP) [ Cherek et al., 1997 ]. The TAP and PSAP are both social provocation games bearing similarities to the Ultimatum Game. These paradigms all involve interactions with computer “partners” who may behave fairly (i.e., make fair divisions of resources) or magnanimously (i.e., chose modest punishments following participant losses) or may not. Furthermore, the experimental manipulation in these paradigms involves changes in the level of provocation shown by computer partners. The few imaging studies conducted, most using the TAP, have found increased responding within dmPFC and AIC/inferior frontal cortex during high-provocation conditions relative to low-provocation conditions [ Kramer et al., 2007 ,  2011 ]; that is, results similar to the response to unfair offers in social exchange paradigms [ King-Casas et al., 2008 ;  Rilling et al., 2008 ;  Sanfey et al., 2003 ]. 
 A region shown to be important for reactive aggression in animal work (in addition to the amygdala) is the PAG [ Gregg and Siegel, 2001 ;  Lin et al., 2011 ;  Nelson and Trainor, 2007 ;  Panksepp, 1998 ]. Reactive aggression is a form of the mammalian-graded response to threat that begins with a freezing response to distant threats, fleeing from closer threats and finally reactive aggression to close threats [ Blanchard et al., 1977 ], which is mediated by greater PAG activity associated with increased threat proximity [ Mobbs et al., 2007 ]. The human fMRI studies of reactive aggression have rarely reported activity in this region (though see  Veit et al., 2010 ). However, this may be an artifact of its relatively inferior location in the brain (there may have been little coverage of the region). Interestingly, PAG responses have been seen in several social exchange paradigms though—both to unfair offers [ Sanfey et al., 2003 ] and while both rejecting [ Corradi-Dell’acqua et al., 2012 ;  Tabibnia et al., 2008 ] and punishing unfair offers [ Strobel et al., 2011 ;  White et al., 2013 ]. Moreover, PAG activity has been reported in human fMRI work to proximal threats [ Mobbs et al., 2007 ,  2010 ]—proximal threats are a cue for reactive aggression [ Blanchard et al., 1977 ]. Interestingly, in this latter context, PAG shows an inverse relationship with vmPFC activity [ Mobbs et al., 2007 ,  2010 ]. The suggestion is that during exposure to a distal threat, vmPFC is engaged to evaluate threat and possible responses to that threat, but when the threat becomes proximal, midbrain regions involved in reflexive escape-behavior, such as PAG, become engaged [ Mobbs et al., 2007 ]. If PAG responses when punishing unfair offers reflect a “fight” response, then one can predict that vmPFC activity might show a reduction in activity when punishing unfair offers. 
 It should be noted that the previous studies examining the punishment of unfair offers have not observed a consistent pattern of modulation of vmPFC activity [ de Quervain et al., 2004 ;  Strobel et al., 2011 ;  White et al., 2013 ]. Thus,  de Quervain et al. [2004]  found that intentional and costly punishment of a provocateur was associated with greater activity within vmPFC than intentional and free punishment. Although at first glance this would be consistent with a view that punishing others was rewarding (cf.  de Quervain et al., 2004 ), vmPFC typically shows increased responses to rewarding relative to punishing stimuli [ Blair et al., 2006 ;  O’Doherty, 2004 ,  2011 ]. It should be noted that this potential reward response was not a function of punishment but rather punishment when it was costly.  Strobel et al. [2011]  did not report vmPFC activity, despite including vmPFC as an a priori region of interest (ROI). However, they did note that this might be related to the “observed signal loss in this area.” (p. 678). Finally,  White et al. [2013] , using the same paradigm as that used in this study but in children, saw decreased vmPFC activity as punishment level (and PAG activity) increased. In short, this latter study was consistent with a role for vmPFC in the regulation of the response to provocation (cf.  Mobbs et al., 2007 ,  2010 ). 
 This study sought to examine blood–oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses to unfair offers and punishment decisions in the context of a social exchange paradigm. We made two opposing sets of predictions. First, if punishing unfair offers engages reward circuitry [ de Quervain et al., 2004 ], we predicted increased modulation of BOLD responses by level of punishment in reward circuitry, such as caudate and vmPFC. Second and alternatively, if punishing unfair offers engages a reactively aggressive response, we predicted positive modulation of the BOLD signal by level of punishment in PAG, but  negative  modulated of activity in vmPFC. 
 
 
 METHODS 
 
 Participants 
 Study volunteers were recruited from the Washington, DC metropolitan area through posted advertisements. Twenty-one participants (nine females) aged between 21 and 49 years (mean = 28.1, standard deviation [SD] = 8.1) were included in all analyses. All participants granted informed consent, were in good health, and had no past history of psychiatric or neurological disease, as determined by a medical examination performed by a licensed physician. The study was approved by the National Institute of Mental Health Institutional Review Board. 
 
 
 Study Measures 
 
 The social fairness game 
 Participants were presented with a variant of the Ultimatum Game [ Sanfey et al., 2003 ]; the Social Fairness Game ( Fig. 1 ). Participants were informed that they would be playing the game with a series of partners. During the game, participants encountered 12 partners, who were indicated by name. Trials were presented randomly. At the outset of each trial, the partners had $20 and the participant had $3. During the offer-phase (3,000 ms), the partner offered to divide their $20 with the participant either fairly (e.g., $10 to participant; $10 to partner) or unfairly (e.g., $6, $4, $2 to participant; $14, $16, $18 to partner). A 500–3,500 ms randomly jittered interval followed the offer-phase. During the decision-phase (4,000 ms), the participants used a button press to indicate whether they wished to (i) accept the partners offer and give up their $3 in exchange (e.g., receive $10 from the fair offer) or (ii) to spend some of their $3 to punish to the partner. Participants had the option to spend $1, $2, or $3 and cost the partner $7, $14, or $21, respectively. Next, during the outcome-phase (3,000 ms), the results of the participants’ choices were displayed (e.g., partner gets −$1, you get $0), followed finally by a second 500–3,500 randomly jittered interval preceded the next trial. Each participant was exposed 120 trails (60 fair trails, 24 $14/$6 trials, 24 $16/$4 trails, and 12 $18/$2 trails) over four 6-min 52-s runs ( Fig. 1 ). 
 
 
 
 MRI Parameters 
 Participants were scanned using a 3T GE Signa scanner. A total of 165 functional images per run were taken with a gradient echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence (repetition time, 2,560 ms; echo time, 27 ms matrix, 64 × 64; flip angle, 90°; field of view, 24 cm). Whole-brain coverage was obtained with 46 axial slices (thickness, 2.5 mm; spacing, 0.5mm; in-plane resolution, 3.75 × 3.75 mm). A high-resolution anatomical scan (three-dimensional spoiled gradient recalled acquisition in a steady state; repetition time, 7 ms; echo time, 2.984 ms; field of view, 24 cm; flip angle, 12°; axial slices, 128; thickness, 1.2 mm; matrix, 256 × 256) in register with the EPI data set was obtained covering the whole brain. 
 
 
 Imaging Data Preprocessing 
 Data were analyzed within the framework of the general linear model using Analysis of Functional Neuroimages (AFNI) [ Cox, 1996 ]. Both individual and group-level analyses were conducted. The first five volumes in each scan series, collected before equilibrium magnetization was reached, were discarded. Motion correction was performed by registering all volumes in the EPI data set to a volume collected close to acquisition of the high-resolution anatomical data set. 
 The EPI data sets for each subject were spatially smoothed (isotropic 6-mm kernel) to reduce variability among individuals and generate group maps. Next, the time series data were normalized by dividing the signal intensity of a voxel at each time point by the mean signal intensity of that voxel for each run and multiplying the result by 100, producing regression coefficients representing percent-signal change. 
 
 General linear model analysis 
 The model involved six motion regressors and the following task regressors: indicator functions for the (i) offer-phase; (ii) decision-phase; (iii) outcome-phase; (iv) offer-phase multiplied by offer unfairness (0 [fair: $10–$10], 8 [unfair: $14–$6], 12[unfair: $16–$4], 16 [unfair: $18–$2]); and (v) decision-phase multiplied by punishment level (ranging from 1 [no punishment: $0 response] to 4 [maximum punishment: $3 response]). As the outcome-phase was a regressor of no interest, it was included only to avoid contamination of the baseline function. In other words, the first three task regressors modeled the average response to each of the three phases of the task (unmodulated), whereas the fourth and fifth modeled the deviation from the average response explained by the offer’s unfairness and the subject’s choice of punishment level. All regressors were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function from the onset of the offer-, decision-, and outcome-phases to account for the slow hemodynamic response. 
 The participants’ anatomical scans were individually registered to the Talairach and Tournoux atlas [ Talairach and Tournoux, 1988 ]. The individuals’ functional EPI data were then registered to their Talairach anatomical scan within AFNI. Linear regression modeling was performed using the five regressors described earlier, plus regressors to model a first-order baseline drift function. This produced  β -coefficients and associated  t -statistics for each voxel and regressor. 
 
 
 
 fMRI Data Analysis 
 The group analysis of the BOLD data was then performed on regression coefficients from individual subject analyses using a  t -test versus baseline for both the offer-phase of the task and the decision-phase of the task. The AFNI ClustSim program was used to establish a  P  = 0.05 corrected threshold (41 voxel clusters at  P  = 0.005) for a whole-brain analysis. All reported regions exceed this threshold. Post hoc analyses were performed to facilitate interpretations. For these analyses, average percent signal change was measured across all voxels within each ROI generated from the functional masks, and data were analyzed using appropriate follow-up tests within SPSS. 
 
 
 
 RESULTS 
 
 Behavioral Results 
 An initial repeated measures (dependent variable—offer unfairness: $10/$10, $14/$6, $16/$4, and $18/$2) ANOVA was conducted on the choice data (independent variable—level of punishment selected: $0, $1, $2, and $3). This revealed a significant linear main effect of offer unfairness [ F (3,18) = 252.73;  P  0.001]; participants spent significantly more money to “punish” the partner as offers became more unfair. A second four-way ANOVA was conducted on the RT data, which also revealed a significant main effect of offer unfairness [ F (3,18) = 9.96,  P  = 0.001]; participants were significantly faster to respond to fair offers than unfair offers and were slowest to respond to $16/$4 offer ( Table I ). Response latencies did not significantly differ for $14/$6 and $18/$2 offers [ t (20) = 0.310,  P  = 0.76], but all other post hoc contrasts were significant [ t s from −5.354 to 2.574,  P s 0.001–0.018]. 
 
 
 fMRI Results 
 The goal of this study was to assess whether the neural correlates associated with punishing unfair offers in a social exchange paradigm are underpinned by circuitry associated with reward processing or circuitry associated with reactive aggression. Two  t -tests comparing both activation in the offer-phase modulated by offer unfairness and activation in the decision-phase modulated by punishment level to baseline were conducted to identify regions showing significant levels of modulated activity. 
 
 
 Modulation by Offer Unfairness 
 Positive modulation by offer unfairness (i.e., activity in these regions increased when offers were more unfair) was observed in regions including dmPFC ( Table II  and  Fig. 2 ). Bilateral AIC also showed positive modulation by offer unfairness, but at subthreshold levels (23 and 20 voxels). We discuss the AIC finding as (i) we made specific predictions about these regions, (ii) the regions were considerably larger than the 10 voxels (initial threshold  P  = 0.005) recommended by  Lieberman and Cunningham 2009 , and (iii) these regions survive in the conjunction analysis (see the next section). 
 
 
 Modulation by Punishment Level 
 Regions showing significant positive modulation by punishment level (i.e., activity in these regions increased when participants punished more) was observed in dmPFC, bilateral AIC, and a region encompassing left caudate/thalamus and PAG ( Fig. 2 ). Given our a priori hypotheses concerning both PAG and caudate, we conducted a follow-up ROI analysis to examine specific activity in both of these regions using the anatomical map from AFNI for caudate and a 10 mm radius sphere using coordinates from the previous study (−3,−25,−5;  Mobbs et al., 2007 ) for PAG. Both caudate and PAG continued to show significant positive modulation by punishment level [ t (20) = 3.524 and 4.177,  P  = 0.002, 0.001, respectively]. Negative modulation by punishment level (i.e., activity in these regions decreased when participants punished more) was observed in vmPFC and PCC. 
 
 
 Differential Response to Offer Versus Punishment 
 A  t -test comparing activation modulated by offer unfairness and activation modulated by punishment level was conducted to identify regions showing differential activity when receiving unfair offers as opposed to when punishing unfair offers ( Table III ). This analysis revealed significantly more positive modulation of activation in regions including a region encompassing left thalamus/caudate/PAG, dorsomedial frontal cortex (dmFC) and bilateral AIC in the decision-phase relative to the offer-phase. Given our a priori hypotheses, caudate and PAG post hoc ROI analyses were again conducted. Both caudate [ t (20) = 3.363,  P  = 0.003] and PAG [ t (20) = 3.610,  P  = 0.002] showed greater levels of positive modulated activation in the decision-phase relative to the offer-phase. Significantly more negative modulation of activity was also observed in PCC and in vmPFC during the decision-phase relative to the offer-phase. 
 
 
 Conjunction Between Offer and Punishment 
 To examine which regions showed significant modulation of activity in both offer and decision-phases, a conjunction analysis was performed ( Fig. 3 ). This revealed significant overlap in the modulation of activity within dmPFC and AIC by offer unfairness and punishment delivered ( Fig. 3 ). Owing to large amounts of overlap between regions at a threshold of  P  = 0.005, the conjunction analysis was conducted at  P  = 0.001. In dmPFC, 75.6% of voxels showing modulated activation by offer unfairness also showed modulated by punishment delivered, whereas 56.0% of voxels showing modulated activity by punishment delivered showed modulated activity by offer unfairness. In both regions of AIC, all voxels showing modulation by offer unfairness also showed modulation by punishment delivered (4.0% of voxels in left AIC and 14.1% of voxels in right AIC modulated by punishment delivered, respectively). 
 
 
 
 DISCUSSION 
 This study investigated neural responses relating to offer unfairness and punishment delivered in the context of a social exchange paradigm. There were four main results. First, increasing offer unfairness and increasing punishment were both associated with increased activity in dmPFC and bilateral AIC. Second, greater caudate responses were associated with greater punishment choices. Third, reduced vmPFC responses were associated with greater punishment choices. Fourth, greater PAG responses were associated with greater punishment choices. 
 Increasing activation in dmPFC and AIC as offer unfairness and level of punishment increased is consistent with the previous studies [ Corradi-Dell’acqua et al., 2012 ;  King-Casas et al., 2008 ;  Rilling et al., 2008 ;  Sanfey et al., 2003 ;  Tabibnia et al., 2008 ;  White et al., 2013 ]. Models of dmPFC activity have most often stressed its role in conflict resolution or error detection [ Botvinick et al., 2001 ,  2004 ;  Carter et al., 1998 ;  Matsumoto et al., 2007 ;  Shima and Tanji, 1998 ]. However, these models have faced empirical challenges and recently a new theory, the predicted-outcome model, has been proposed, which accounts for these challenges [ Alexander and Brown, 2011 ]. This model posits that dmPFC neurons generate signals reflecting predictions of the probability and timing of the various possible outcomes of an action. These predictions are inhibited when the corresponding predicted outcome actually occurs and therefore dmPFC activity is maximal when an expected outcome  fails to occur . This new model is particularly attractive in the current context, as it overlaps with positions on the response to unfair offers; that is, that they represent error signals to the social norm that allocations of resources should be equitable [ Pillutla and Murnighan, 1996 ]—the activity is seen when the expected norm is  failed to be adhered to  [ Montague and Lohrenz, 2007 ]. Suggestions concerning dmPFC and AIC/IFG functioning can be integrated, such that dmPFC is thought to be sensitive to unexpected outcomes (cf.  Alexander and Brown, 2011 ) and AIC/IFG orchestrates potentially necessary changes in behavioral response (cf.  Blair and Cipolotti, 2000 ;  Budhani et al., 2007 ). 
 Previous study has reported that choosing to punish unfair offers is associated with increased activation in striatal regions [ de Quervain et al., 2004 ;  Strobel et al., 2011 ;  White et al., 2013 ]. It has been suggested that punishing unfair offers is rewarding and that this reward value of punishing others is signaled by the caudate [ de Quervain et al., 2004 ]. In line with this position, this study revealed that caudate activity increased as the punishment level delivered by the subjects increased. On the basis of the study by  de Quervain et al. [2004] , it could be argued that increasing levels of punishment were increasingly rewarding—probably because increased punishment was typically seen in response to the most unfair offers. However, while caudate, and striatum more generally, have been associated with reward processing, it is suggested that they do so, not in isolation, but as a part of a larger circuit, including regions such as vmPFC [ O’Doherty, 2011 ] and PCC [ Ballard and Knutson, 2009 ;  Levy and Glimcher, 2011 ;  McClure et al., 2007 ]. Yet, in this study, vmPFC and PCC showed decreasing activity as punishment level increased. Moreover, this was also seen in a previous study using the same paradigm in children [ White et al., 2013 ]. Indeed, vmPFC (and caudate) activity has been associated with the rewarding value of fair offers in other study [ Tabibnia et al., 2008 ]. 
 It is also worth noting that if punishment itself was rewarding, it might be expected to be associated with activity within the ventral area of the striatum and the head of the caudate (anonymous reviewer’s suggestion). These regions are the ones most consistently implicated in reward-related learning (for a review, see  Haber and Knutson, 2010 ), not the dorsal striatum/body of the caudate that was seen in this study. Of the three previous studies examining the neural correlates of punishment during social exchange, only one showed clear ventral striatum activation and even here the activation extended into dorsal areas of caudate [ Strobel et al., 2011 ]. The other two studies [ de Quervain et al., 2004 ;  White et al., 2013 ] observed that punishment level was associated with activation mainly in dorsal caudate and not within nucleus accumbens or caudate head (though this is somewhat difficult to ascertain in the former case particularly as the voxel of peak activation appears to be in white matter). 
 What might then the caudate activity seen in the current, and previous, work on punishing unfair offers represent? Striatum has been implicated in action selection [ Redgrave et al., 2011 ] with a role in both facilitating motor output and suppressing it [ Aron et al., 2003 ;  Hikosaka et al., 2000 ;  Mink, 1996 ]. These processes are known to be implemented via frontostriatal loops [ Kehagia et al., 2010 ;  van Veen and Carter, 2005 ]. Importantly, response conflict can be seen to activate not only caudate but also dorsomedial and dorsolateral frontal cortex and anterior insula/inferior frontal cortex (e.g., in the context of Stroop tasks,  Ali et al., 2010 ;  Jiang and Egner, 2013 ;  Liu et al., 2004 ;  van Veen and Carter, 2005 ). These were all regions that, in this study, showed increasing activity, like the caudate, as the participant increased their punishment level. Moreover, previous study with social exchange tasks (and reactive aggressive tasks;  Kramer et al., 2011 ), has seen co-occurring activity in these regions [ Tabibnia et al., 2008 ;  White et al., 2013 ]. The caudate activity may be part of the integrated response of these two structures in over-riding more social, nonpunishing responses. 
 On the basis of the overlap in response to unfair offers and provocation in reactive aggression paradigms, and data indicating the important role of PAG in mammalian reactive aggression [ Gregg and Siegel, 2001 ;  Lin et al., 2011 ;  Nelson and Trainor, 2007 ;  Panksepp, 1998 ], we predicted that if punishment in social exchange paradigms reflects a retaliatory response akin to reactive aggression, then it would be associated with PAG activity. In line with this prediction, increasing punishment was associated with increasing PAG activity. Reactive aggression is a form of the mammalian-graded response to threat which begins with a freezing response to distant threats, fleeing from closer threats and finally reactive aggression to close threats [ Blanchard et al., 1977 ]. Previous study examining threat proximity has indeed shown increasing PAG activity with increasing threat proximity [ Mobbs et al., 2007 ]. Interestingly, these studies have reported that vmPFC activity decreases as PAG activity increases. Here, we see increasing PAG activity with increasing retaliatory punishment and that this is associated with decreased vmPFC activity. Within this literature, it is argued that vmPFC is part of “higher cortical control systems [that] control behavior when the degree of threat is appraised as non-life-endangering and guides the organism to choose the most effective and resourceful strategy for instrumental avoidance. At extreme levels of threat, the PAG may in turn inhibit more complex control processes when a fast and indeed obligatory response is required [ Mobbs et al., 2007 , pp. 1082-1083].” 
 One caveat should be noted here. Studies examining reactive aggression through the TAP have typically not observed PAG activity [ Kramer et al., 2007 ,  2011 ]. However, this may reflect the scanning parameters used in these studies. In both these studies, a total of 128 mm of brain (inferior–superior on the AC–PC axis, 32 4-mm slices) was acquired. In contrast, in this study, 138 mm of brain was acquired (inferior–superior, 46 2.5 mm slices with 0.5 mm spacing), whereas that of  Strobel et al. [2011] , which also observed PAG activity when punishing another, acquired 30 5-mm slices for an even larger coverage of 150 mm. As such, the failure of the previous studies of reactive aggression to observe PAG activity may reflect a lack of recorded signal within this region. 
 There are two limitations of this study that should be mentioned. First, the paradigm in this study used only four data points to model a punishment response. The subsequent analysis of this data assumes a linear relationship between change in parametrically modulated neural activation and increases in punishment. As four data points may be insufficient to determine a linear relationship, it is possible that the relationship between modulated activation and punishment may be curvilinear (anonymous reviewer’s suggestion). However, two factors mitigate this limitation. First, the behavioral data were highly linear as indicated by the with-in subjects contrasts output from the repeated-measures ANOVA ( F  = 252.729,  P  0.001). Quadratic and cubic models were not significant ( F s of 0.287 and 1.902,  P  = 0.598 and 0.183, respectively). Second, we suggest that a linear relationship between modulated activation and punishment response is not vital to this study. Our main point is that vmPFC and caudate, if they are both representing a reward response, should both show increased activation as a function of increased punishment. This is not the case in the current data. Importantly, even if a curvilinear model better fit the data, it does not seem plausible that at any point the directionality of either vmPFC or caudate activity as a function of punishment would change. Second, we did not assess participants’ propensity to reactive aggression. It would be clearly predicted from our position above that individuals with such an increased propensity should show an exaggeration of the recruitment of PAG, in particular, as a function of punishment level. Our on-going study currently tests this prediction with patients with Conduct Disorder. 
 
 
 CONCLUSIONS 
 In summary, the current data are consistent with a reactive aggression response to provocation in social exchange paradigms. Increased activation of PAG, a region involved in threat/provocation response, was observed in response to increasing level of punishment. Furthermore, vmPFC showed decreasing activation with increasing punishment, consistent with a reactive aggression response, but inconsistent with the idea that punishing others’ unfair offers is inherently rewarding. The increased activation seen in caudate with increasing levels of punishment, in conjunction with activity in dmFC, AIC, and PAG, may represent coordination of a motor response associated with reactive aggression as opposed to reward processing.

 The Social Fairness Game. Participants asked to choose, via button press, whether they would accept a fair ( A ) or unfair  B / C / D ) division of $20. Participants then chose, via button press, to accept the offer ( E ) or to punish the individual making the offer. For every $1 (of $3) punishment-money spent, the individual making the offer lost $7 ( F / G / H ). 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 2 
 
 Regions showing activation in the offer-phase, in the decision-phase and regions showing significant difference in modulation by punishment level as opposed to offer unfairness.
