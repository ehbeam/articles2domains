 Cognitive development is shaped by brain plasticity during childhood, yet
little is known about changes in large-scale functional circuits associated with
learning in academically relevant cognitive domains such as mathematics. Here,
we investigate plasticity of intrinsic brain circuits associated with one-on-one
math tutoring and its relation to individual differences in children’s
learning. We focused on functional circuits associated with the intraparietal
sulcus (IPS) and angular gyrus (AG), cytoarchitectonically distinct subdivisions
of the human parietal cortex with different roles in numerical cognition.
Tutoring improved performance and strengthened IPS connectivity with the lateral
prefrontal cortex, ventral temporal-occipital cortex, and hippocampus.
Crucially, increased IPS connectivity was associated with individual performance
gains, highlighting the behavioral significance of plasticity in IPS circuits.
Tutoring-related changes in IPS connectivity were distinct from those of the
adjacent AG, which did not predict performance gains. Our findings provide new
insights into plasticity of functional brain circuits associated with the
development of specialized cognitive skills in children.

 1. Introduction 
 In contrast to the traditional view of brain maturation as the unfolding of a
genetically preprogrammed trajectory, most current theories of brain development
emphasize the role of learning, experience, and education in shaping brain function
and structure ( Posner & Rothbart,
2007 ). While previous studies of cognitive development have primarily
focused on activation of individual brain areas, there is growing evidence to
suggest that the emergence of regional functional specialization and fine-tuning of
neuronal response properties is influenced by activity-dependent interactions and
competition with other brain regions ( Menon,
2013 ;  Passingham, Stephan, &
Kotter, 2002 ). This process of interactive specialization and
reorganization of functional circuits is thought to play a prominent role in
children’s cognitive development ( Johnson,
2001 ,  2011 ;  Menon, 2013 ). Along the same lines, it has been proposed
that repeated co-activation strengthens intrinsic functional connections between
brain regions, resulting in increased differentiation between functional brain
networks that subserve distinct cognitive processes ( Fair et al., 2007 ;  Fox &
Raichle, 2007 ;  Jolles, van Buchem, Crone,
& Rombouts, 2013 ;  Kelly et al.,
2009 ;  Mackey, Singley, & Bunge,
2013 ;  Supekar, Menon, Rubin, Musen,
& Greicius, 2008 ). These processes are particularly relevant for
complex cognitive skills that rely on coordinated interactions between distributed
brain structures. For example, numerical problem solving, an important component of
children’s cognitive development, depends on interactions between the
posterior parietal cortex, lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), and ventral
temporal-occipital cortex (VTOC), regions associated with the representation and
manipulation of quantity and symbolic information ( Arsalidou & Taylor, 2011 ;  Cho et
al., 2012 ;  Rosenberg-Lee, Barth,
& Menon, 2011 ;  Supekar &
Menon, 2012 ). Despite its broad theoretical importance and practical
relevance for understanding cognitive development, little is known about plasticity
of intrinsic functional brain circuits related to learning in academically relevant
cognitive domains in children. 
 Here, we use one-on-one cognitive tutoring to investigate plasticity of
multi-component functional brain circuits associated with mathematical learning in
elementary school children. The tutoring emphasized both procedural and conceptual
knowledge as well as practicing fluent retrieval of number combinations from memory.
Physical manipulatives were used to strengthen visuospatial representation of number
combinations, while timed flash cards were used to encourage memory retrieval ( Iuculano et al., 2015 ;  Supekar et al., 2013 ). The multifaceted nature of the
tutoring facilitated engagement of distributed brain regions involved in numerical,
visuospatial, strategic, and mnemonic processes ( Iuculano et al., 2015 ). Furthermore, previous findings suggest that the
brain’s intrinsic functional and structural network architecture provides a
scaffold for the development of specialized cognitive skills ( Supekar et al., 2013 ). More specifically, Supekar and
colleagues reported that pre-tutoring brain structure and intrinsic functional
connectivity were predictive of tutoring outcome, while behavioral measures,
including IQ, working memory, and mathematical abilities were not. It is also likely
that learning and experience  alter  functional brain circuits in
ways that facilitate cognitive processing. In the present study, we, therefore,
investigated how a well-designed cognitive tutoring protocol changes intrinsic
functional brain circuits in children and whether these changes are associated with
individual differences in learning. 
 We focused on functional circuits associated with cytoarchitectonically
distinct subdivisions of the posterior parietal cortex ( Caspers et al., 2008 ;  Caspers et al., 2006 ) that are known to play important but different
roles in mathematical cognition ( Ansari, 2015 ;
 Dehaene, Piazza, Pinel, & Cohen,
2003 ;  Menon, 2015b ): the
intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and angular gyrus (AG). Despite their close proximity,
the IPS and AG display markedly different profiles of brain response during
numerical cognition ( Dehaene, Spelke, Pinel,
Stanescu, & Tsivkin, 1999 ;  Grabner et al., 2009 ;  Rosenberg-Lee,
Chang, Young, Wu, & Menon, 2011 ;  Wu et al., 2009 ) and exhibit functional connectivity with distinct brain
circuits ( Fox et al., 2005 ;  Nelson et al., 2010 ;  Uddin et al., 2010 ). The IPS is thought to play a particularly important
role in quantity representation, numerical magnitude judgment, and arithmetic
problem solving ( Arsalidou & Taylor,
2011 ;  Bugden, Price, McLean, &
Ansari, 2012 ;  Cantlon, Brannon, Carter,
& Pelphrey, 2006 ;  Dehaene et al.,
2003 ;  Menon, Rivera, White, Glover,
& Reiss, 2000 ;  Piazza, Izard,
Pinel, Le Bihan, & Dehaene, 2004 ;  Rosenberg-Lee, Chang, et al., 2011 ;  Wu
et al., 2009 ) and has strong intrinsic connections with lateral PFC and
VTOC regions ( Uddin et al., 2010 ), associated
with executive control and symbolic processing, respectively. In contrast, the AG is
a key node of the default mode network, a brain system that is typically deactivated
during arithmetic problem solving ( Rosenberg-Lee,
Lovett, & Anderson, 2009 ;  Wu et
al., 2009 ) and intrinsically anti-correlated with the IPS ( Fox et al., 2005 ;  Uddin et al., 2010 ). While the AG has been linked to
verbal retrieval of math facts ( Dehaene et al.,
2003 ;  Dehaene et al., 1999 ;  Grabner et al., 2009 ), recent studies suggest
that AG plays a more general attentional role that is not specific to math fact
retrieval (Bloechle et al., 2016;  Rosenberg-Lee,
Chang, et al., 2011 ;  Wu et al.,
2009 ). 
 Given the central role of the IPS in numerical cognition and its
co-activation with multiple subregions of the PFC and VTOC ( Arsalidou & Taylor, 2011 ;  Menon, 2015a ), we hypothesized that intensive tutoring
would strengthen intrinsic functional connectivity of the IPS with the PFC and VTOC.
Based on an interactive specialization model, which postulates that development and
learning result in increased differentiation between functional brain circuits
( Johnson, 2011 ), we predicted that
tutoring-related changes in IPS connectivity would differ from changes in AG
connectivity. We reasoned that AG connectivity with the PFC and VTOC would not be
strengthened due to the AG’s involvement in the default mode network and its
deactivation during mathematical problem solving. Instead, we predicted that
learning would alter AG connectivity with other nodes of the default mode network,
such as the medial temporal lobe (MTL) memory system including the hippocampus. We
demonstrate that tutoring results in dissociable changes in functional circuits
associated with the IPS and AG and determine the relation of these changes to
individual differences in learning. 
 
 
 2. Materials & Methods 
 
 2.1 Overall study design 
 The study consisted of four phases ( Jolles et al., 2015 ;  Supekar et al.,
2013 ): (i) initial neuropsychological assessments, (ii) Time 1
assessment of arithmetic performance and brain imaging, (iii) 8-week one-on-one
math tutoring ( Fuchs et al., 2013 ;  Fuchs et al., 2009 ), and (iv) Time 2
assessment of arithmetic performance and brain imaging ( Figure 1A ). Both brain imaging sessions started with a
resting-state fMRI scan, which allowed us to examine intrinsic connectivity
independent of task performance and strategy changes. The present study builds
on our previous structural ( Jolles et al.,
2015 ;  Supekar et al., 2013 )
and task-activation studies ( Iuculano et al.,
2015 ) and for the first time, examines plasticity of intrinsic
functional circuits, using resting-state fMRI data from each child at both Time
1 and Time 2. 
 To rule out test-retest effects we recruited a separate cohort of
third-grade children, a comparison group that underwent the identical scanning
and testing procedures in phase i, ii, and iv of the main experiment. However,
children in the comparison group did not receive math tutoring and were not
enrolled in outside school math tutoring activities. Because children were
enrolled in different schools and recruited all year around, it is unlikely that
these children had a common experience with math instruction that contributed to
consistent changes of IPS or AG connectivity. 
 
 
 2.2 Participants 
 Forty-six children in grade 3, recruited from multiple school districts
in the San Francisco Bay Area, took part in the math tutoring study. Eighteen
children were excluded due to excessive head movement or bad data quality during
either of the scan sessions, four were excluded due to equipment failure, and
two because they did not complete both resting-state scans. One child with a
diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was also excluded.
The final sample of the tutoring group included twenty-one children (mean age
= 8.61;  SD  = 0.42; 13 females, 8 males;
full-scale IQ = 103.90;  SD  = 12.58).
Neuropsychological test results of the participants, including academic and
cognitive achievement, are presented in  Table S1 . None of the children in the final sample were
left-handed (as assessed using the Edinburgh handedness test), or had a history
of neurological or psychiatric disorders. 
 Thirty-two children in grade 3 were recruited in the comparison group.
Three children dropped out after the first scanning session and eight children
were excluded due to excessive head movement or bad data quality during either
of the scan sessions. The final sample included twenty-one children (mean age
= 9.02;  SD  = 0.43; 14 females, 7 males;
full-scale IQ = 118.62,  SD  = 14.34).
Neuropsychological test results are presented in  Table S2 . None of the
children in the final sample were left-handed or had a history of neurological
or psychiatric disorders. 
 Informed consent was obtained from the legal guardian of the child, and
study protocols were approved by the Stanford University Institutional Review
Board. 
 
 
 2.3 Tutoring 
 Children in the tutoring group completed an intervention program adapted
from Math Wise ( Fuchs et al., 2009 ) and
Galaxy Math ( Fuchs et al., 2013 ), which
combined conceptual instruction with speeded practice of simple addition and
subtraction problems ( Supekar et al.,
2013 ). This tutoring program has previously been shown effective in
school-based studies of children with low math skills ( Fuchs et al., 2013 ;  Fuchs et al., 2009 ). Similar to MathWise and Galaxy Math, the
tutoring involved a total of 15–20 hours of training, but it was
condensed to 8/9 weeks with longer lessons (i.e., 3 times per week, for
40–50 minutes). The tutoring consisted of 22 lessons of increasing
difficulty. Details of the lessons are described in  Supplementary Materials and
Methods . 
 
 
 2.4 Tutoring Outcome Measures 
 Math problem solving was assessed before and after tutoring using
addition and subtraction verification tasks during fMRI scanning. There were at
least two addition and two subtraction runs per session, which included 12
arithmetic problems each. For the analyses presented here, we focused on
behavioral data from the first two addition and two subtraction runs that were
available for analyses. Arithmetic problems were presented horizontally in green
lettering on a black background. Half the math problems were correct (e.g., 3
+ 4 = 7), and the other half deviated from the correct answer by
±1 or ±2 (e.g., 3 + 5 = 7). Only single-digit
operand addition problems were included, and problems with 1 or 0 were excluded.
The corresponding subtraction problems (e.g., 7 − 5 = 3 and 14
− 5 = 9) were presented in the subtraction task. In the addition
task, the larger operand was equally likely to appear in the first or second
position. Each trial started with a fixation asterisk for 0.5 seconds. The
arithmetic problem was presented for up to 9.5 seconds, during which the child
had to make a response. Participants used a response box held in their right
hand, to indicate “1” if the problem was correct and
“2” if the problem was incorrect. After the child made a
response, the problem disappeared from the screen, and a black screen appeared
for the remainder of the 9.5 seconds. Non-arithmetic control problems were
randomly interspersed with arithmetic trials but were not analyzed here. In this
task two numbers were presented in the format of “n = m”
where n and m were numbers between 0 and 25. Half of the control problems were
presented as correctly matched pairs (e.g., 3 = 3) and the other half
deviated from the true answer by ±1 or ±2 (e.g., 3 = 5).
Children were asked to indicate “1” if the two numbers were the
same or “2” if the two numbers were different. 
 To derive an aggregate measure that captures global performance changes
across the addition and subtraction verification tasks, we computed an
“efficiency score”, based on the definition of efficiency by
 Salthouse and Hedden (2002) .
Efficiency change was calculated as follows: (1) for each of the four behavioral
measures separately (i.e., accuracy and response time (RT) for addition and
subtraction problems), we calculated z-scores based on the group mean and
standard deviation  across  Time 1 and Time 2; (2) we averaged
the z-scores for accuracy and the inverted z-scores for RT for each participant
within each time-point; (3) efficiency change was calculated by subtracting Time
1 efficiency from Time 2 efficiency ( Supekar et
al., 2013 ). Analyses of performance improvement were conducted using
repeated measures ANOVAs. Outliers with performance changes > 3
 SD s on any of the behavioral measures (accuracy and RT for
addition and subtraction) were excluded from the analyses. Invalid trials
(during which button presses other than 1 or 2 were recorded) were treated as
missing values in the analysis. If there were more than two invalid trials in a
run, we used the subsequent run for that participant. If there were signs of
button box failure (i.e., lack of responses on more than 1/3 of the trials in
children with otherwise high performance), we also used the subsequent run for
that participant. 
 
 
 2.5 Brain imaging 
 
 2.5.1 Data acquisition 
 Brain imaging data were acquired on a 3T GE Signa scanner (General
Electric, Milwaukee, WI) using the GE 8 channel head coil at the Stanford
University Lucas Center. Participants were instructed to lay still with
their eyes closed for the duration of the entire scan. Twenty nine axial
slices (4.0 mm thickness, 0.5 mm skip) were collected parallel to the AC-PC
line, using a T2* weighted gradient echo spiral in-out pulse
sequence ( Glover & Lai, 1998 )
(180 volumes; TR = 2000ms; TE=30ms, flip angle
=80°, 1 interleave). Sc ans were acquired with a field of
view of 20 × 20 cm and a matrix size of 64 × 64, providing
an in-plane spatial resolution of 3.125 mm. To reduce blurring and signal
loss from field in-homogeneity, an automated high-order shimming method
based on spiral acquisitions was used before acquiring the functional MRI
scan ( Kim, Adalsteinsson, Glover, &
Spielman, 2002 ). A high-resolution T1-weighted spoiled grass
gradient recalled (SPGR) inversion recovery 3D MRI sequence was acquired to
facilitate anatomical localization of resting-state fMRI connectivity maps.
The following parameters were used: TI = 300 ms, TR = 8.4
ms; TE = 1.8 ms; flip angle = 15°; 22 cm field of
view; 132 slices in coronal plane; 256 × 192 matrix; 2 NEX, acquired
resolution = 1.5 × 0.9 × 1.1 mm. Brain imaging data
of the comparison group were acquired on a 3T GE Discovery scanner (General
Electric, Milwaukee, WI), using the same imaging parameters as were used in
the tutoring group. 
 
 
 2.5.2 Movement 
 Head movement was minimized during scanning by a comfortable,
custom-built restraint. We first excluded any children with movement larger
than 5 mm in either the x, y, or z directions at either time point. In the
tutoring group, the movement range was on average 0.43 ( SD 
0.46), 0.76 ( SD  0.64), and 1.68 ( SD  1.09)
mm in the x, y, and z direction respectively at Time 1, with 0.91
( SD  0.91), 1.98 ( SD  1.36), 0.70
( SD  0.57) degrees roll, pitch, and yaw. At Time 2, the
movement range was on average 0.37 (SD 0.29), 0.62 (SD 0.55), and 1.28 (SD
0.91) mm in the x, y, and z direction, with 0.71 (SD 0.46), 1.94 (SD 1.10),
0.53 (SD 0.31) degrees roll, pitch, and yaw. Mean scan-to-scan displacement
of movement (which considers both translational and rotational motion) did
not exceed 0.5 mm for all participants. There were no significant
differences in movement between Time 1 and Time 2 (Multivariate ANOVA:
 F (6,15) = 0.77,  p  =
.609, η p 2  = .234; Univariate ANOVAs:
 p  > .05 for all six movement parameters).
Therefore, it is unlikely that changes of connectivity will be driven by
changes in motion. To further study the relation between movement changes
and connectivity changes, and to possibly control for such differences, we
performed ROI analyses, which are presented in the  supplementary
material . 
 In the comparison group, the movement range was on average 0.56
( SD  0.56), 1.13 ( SD  1.16), and 1.15
( SD  0.89) mm in the x, y, and z direction respectively
at Time 1, with 0.67 ( SD  0.47), 2.55 ( SD 
2.17), 0.67 ( SD  0.67) degrees roll, pitch, and yaw. At Time
2, the movement range was on average 0.34 (SD 0.22), 0.68 (SD 0.58), and
0.96 (SD 0.69) mm in the x, y, and z direction, with 0.44 (SD 0.20), 1.58
(SD 1.61), 0.40 (SD 0.20) degrees roll, pitch, and yaw. Mean scan-to-scan
displacement of movement did not exceed 0.5 mm for all participants.
Overall, there were no significant differences in movement between Time 1
and Time 2 (Multivariate ANOVA:  F (6,15) = 1.08,
 p  = .419, η p 2 
= .301, Univariate ANOVAs  p  > .05 for all
movement parameters except roll). There were no differences between the
tutoring and comparison groups in movement changes between Time 1 and Time 2
(Multivariate ANOVA:  F (6,35) = 1.25,
 p  = .306, η p 2 
= .176; Univariate ANOVAs:  p  > .05 for all
six movement parameters). 
 
 
 2.5.3 fMRI data preprocessing 
 The first 6 volumes were not analyzed to allow for signal
equilibration effects. A linear shim correction was applied separately for
each slice during reconstruction using a magnetic field map acquired
automatically by the pulse sequence at the beginning of the scan ( Glover & Lai, 1998 ). FMRI data
were preprocessed and analyzed using SPM8 ( http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm ). Preprocessing procedures
included slice time correction, coregistration to the individual’s
structural data, normalization to the standard Montreal Neurological
Institute (MNI) T1 template, and spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel
(6 mm full-width at half-maximum). A bandpass filter (0.008 to 0.1 Hz) was
applied to the smoothed data to remove high frequency artifacts. For
coregistration, we used the individual’s structural MRI scan from
Time 1 or Time 2 with the highest quality rating. Data from two participants
(one from the tutoring group and one from the comparison group) were
normalized to the MNI template directly, omitting the coregistration step
because of the poor quality of their structural data. 
 
 
 2.5.4 IPS and AG regions of interest (ROIs) 
 Our analysis specifically focused on the left IPS and AG, which are
thought to be involved in distinct and often anti-correlated functional
networks: the fronto-parietal network and the default mode network,
respectively ( Fox et al., 2005 ;  Nelson et al., 2010 ;  Uddin et al., 2010 ). Moreover, IPS and AG are
believed to have different contributions to math cognition. The IPS plays a
domain-specific role in approximation and complex mathematical problem
solving. In contrast, some studies have implicated the AG in verbal
retrieval of math facts from long-term memory ( Dehaene et al., 2003 ;  Dehaene et al., 1999 ), while others have argued
that the AG has a domain general role in attention allocation during
retrieval (Bloechle et al., 2016). Our analyses focused on IPS and AG in the
left hemisphere, given their hypothesized roles in mediating symbolic number
processing and arithmetic competence ( Bugden
et al., 2012 ), as well as prior findings of left-lateralized
changes with learning and development ( Ansari
& Dhital, 2006 ;  Cantlon et
al., 2006 ;  Jolles et al.,
2015 ;  Rivera, Reiss, Eckert,
& Menon, 2005 ). 
 Observer-independent cytoarchitectonically-defined IPS and AG seed
regions of interest (seed-ROIs) were created using the Anatomy Toolbox in
SPM8. For the IPS, we combined the maximum probability maps of subdivisions
hIP1, hIP2, and hIP3 into a single seed region ( Figure 2 ). For the AG, we used the PGp subdivision
because of its distinct pattern of brain response and connectivity from the
IPS ( Rosenberg-Lee, Chang, et al.,
2011 ;  Uddin et al., 2010 ).
There was no overlap between the IPS and AG seed-ROIs. Detailed information
about the anatomical boundaries of these maps has been published elsewhere
( Caspers et al., 2008 ;  Caspers et al., 2006 ;  Choi et al., 2006 ). The MarsBar toolbox
( http://marsbar.sourceforge.net/ ) was used to create binary
seed-ROIs from these maps. 
 Finally, to examine whether tutoring induced connectivity changes in
regions that are not related to mathematical processing, we also included a
control seed-ROI encompassing the right Heschl’s gyrus, which was
defined using the Harvard-Oxford atlas in FSL ( http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/Atlases ). 
 
 
 2.5.5 Individual subject analysis 
 For the functional connectivity analysis, we used a seed-correlation
approach similar to that described in  Uddin
et al. (2010) . First level analyses were performed on a
subject-by-subject and session-by-session basis. For each seed-ROI
separately, we extracted the first eigenvector time course, and we
calculated how strongly that time course fitted the data at each voxel using
a General Linear Model (GLM). The global time course (computed across all
voxels of the brain) as well as 6 motion parameters were included as
additional covariates in the model to take into account the effects of
physiological noise and participant movement. 
 
 
 2.5.6 Functional connectivity changes in response to math
tutoring 
 Individual contrast images were submitted to group level analyses,
which were conducted across the 21 participants in the tutoring group. We
conducted the following analyses: (1) paired t-tests to compare IPS and AG
connectivity before and after tutoring; (2) time × region analyses
using the Flexible Factorial Model to examine differences and similarities
between IPS and AG in changes of functional connectivity; (3) paired t-tests
to examine tutoring-related changes of functional connectivity of the IPS
and AG, separately. 
 All functional connectivity maps were masked using a grey matter
image and thresholded at  p  < 0.01 height, with FWE
corrections for multiple spatial comparisons at the cluster level
( p  < 0.01, spatial extent 128 voxels). The
cluster size was determined using Monte Carlo simulations implemented in
Matlab (cf.  Rosenberg-Lee, Barth, et al.,
2011 ). 
 
 
 2.5.7 Brain-behavior correlations 
 ROI analyses were performed to examine whether changes in functional
connectivity were associated with changes in performance efficiency
(composite of accuracy and RT on the verification tasks). ROIs were defined
based on the clusters that showed changes in functional connectivity with
IPS and AG. We created 10 mm diameter spheres centered at the peak voxels of
each cluster, from which we extracted each individual’s beta values
from Time 1 and Time 2. Differences in beta values were computed for each
ROI in each individual and correlated with changes in individual performance
efficiency. 
 In addition, we conducted exploratory analyses to examine whether
tutoring-related performance changes were correlated with connectivity
changes with right hippocampus, a region whose volume predicted individual
performance gains in a prior study ( Supekar
et al., 2013 ). We used the same right hippocampal ROI that was
used in the prior study, which was centered at the peak identified by the
voxel-based morphometry analysis (MNI coordinates 38 −19
−18) ( Supekar et al.,
2013 ). 
 
 
 2.5.8 Test-retest effects in the comparison group 
 Finally, test-retest effects were examined using a no-contact
comparison group. Differences in scanner and cognitive measures at Time 1
precluded a direct comparison with the tutoring group. Instead, we first
performed an ROI analysis focusing on the peaks of the cortical and
subcortical clusters that showed functional connectivity changes in the
tutoring group. We examined whether IPS or AG showed connectivity changes
with any of these regions, and whether connectivity changes were correlated
with performance changes. Next, we performed whole-brain paired
 t -tests of the IPS and AG separately, similar to the
analyses that were performed in the tutoring group. 
 
 
 
 
 3. Results 
 
 3.1 Behavior 
 
 Performance improvement after math tutoring 
 To examine performance improvements associated with the tutoring, we
used data from the addition and subtraction verification tasks. Two outliers
(with change scores > 3  SD s) were excluded from the
analyses. We found that math tutoring was associated with significant
improvements in performance efficiency ( F (1,18) =
37.54,  p  < .001, η p 2 
= .676;  Figure 1B ). Follow-up
analyses indicated performance gains on both tasks for accuracy (addition:
 F (1,18) = 9.89,  p  =
.006, η p 2  = .355; subtraction:
 F (1,18) = 21.81,  p  <
.001, η p 2  = .548), as well as RT
(addition:  F (1,18) = 32.18,  p 
< .001, η p 2  = .641;
subtraction:  F (1,18) = 5.95,  p 
= .025, η p 2  = .249). 
 
 
 Test-retest effects in the comparison group 
 Next, we examined performance changes in the comparison group. Two
participants were excluded due to data loss from technical issues during
data acquisition. Overall, we did not find significant gains in performance
efficiency on the verification tasks ( F (1,18) =
0.97,  p  = .337, η p 2 
= .051). Follow-up analyses showed reduced RT on the subtraction
task ( F (1,18) = 7.71,  p  =
.012, η p 2  = .300), but there were no
changes on any of the other measures (addition accuracy:
 F (1,18) < .001,  p  = 1.00,
η p 2  < .001; subtraction accuracy:
 F (1,18) = 0.18,  p  =
.679, η p 2  = .010; addition RT:
 F (1,18) = 0.77,  p  =
.392, η p 2  = .041). 
 
 
 
 3.2 Functional connectivity differences between IPS and AG seed ROIs 
 
 IPS and AG are associated with different functional brain
networks 
 We first examined IPS and AG connectivity at Time 1. As previously
described in adults ( Uddin et al.,
2010 ), IPS and AG were associated with different functional brain
networks, the dorsolateral fronto-parietal network and the default mode
network respectively. When IPS and AG connectivity were compared directly,
we found that the left IPS showed stronger functional connectivity with
supramarginal gyrus and superior parietal lobule in the posterior parietal
cortex, as well as inferior and middle frontal gyrus (IFG, MFG) in the
lateral PFC. Furthermore, IPS showed stronger functional connectivity with
VTOC. In contrast, the AG showed stronger functional connectivity with
posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, right AG, lateral occipital cortex,
and medial PFC ( Table
S3 ;  Figure 3A ). IPS and AG
connectivity after tutoring (Time 2) was generally observed in the same
brain areas as before tutoring, but to a greater extent ( Figure 3B ). 
 
 
 
 3.3 Changes in functional connectivity with tutoring 
 
 Changes in IPS and AG connectivity 
 We next examined tutoring-related changes in intrinsic functional
connectivity of the IPS and AG. A flexible factorial model with Time (Time
1, Time 2) and Region (IPS, AG) as factors revealed a main effect of IPS and
AG connectivity changes with the left posterior MTL (hippocampus and
parahippocampal gyrus), lingual gyrus, thalamus, putamen, and IFG ( Figure 4A ;  Table S4 ). To
directly contrast tutoring effects on IPS and AG connectivity, we examined
the interaction between the factors Time (Time 1, Time 2) and Region (IPS,
AG). This analysis indicated that, relative to the AG, the IPS showed larger
increases of functional connectivity with bilateral lateral PFC (MFG and
frontal pole) and left VTOC (temporal-occipital part of the inferior and
middle temporal gyrus) ( Figure 4B ;
 Table S5 ).
Right pre/postcentral gyrus and right occipital cortex showed the opposite
pattern—these regions showed greater connectivity increases for the
AG than the IPS. Taken together, these results suggest that changes in IPS
connectivity are largely distinct from changes in the adjacent AG, although
there was unexpected convergence in the MTL. 
 To better assess the direction of effects, we then used paired
 t -tests examining tutoring-related changes in IPS and
AG connectivity separately. This analysis revealed increased left IPS
connectivity with VTOC (right fusiform and left lingual gyri), lateral PFC
(right IFG and frontal pole), ventromedial PFC, MTL (left hippocampus and
parahippocampal gyrus), left superior temporal gyrus, and the cerebellum
( Figure 5A ;  Table S6 ). In
contrast, the AG showed increased functional connectivity with only the
right pre/postcentral gyrus, confirming that IPS and AG related circuits are
differently reconfigured by math tutoring ( Figure 5B ;  Table S6 ). 
 
 
 No changes in Heschl’s gyrus connectivity 
 Finally, we conducted control analyses using a seed-ROI in the right
Heschl’s gyrus. Heschl’s gyrus is a primary sensory area,
not specifically involved in any aspect of our math tutoring protocol, and
therefore not expected to show changes of functional connectivity. In
agreement with this hypothesis, the right Heschl’s gyrus did not
show any changes of functional connectivity to anywhere in the brain. 
 
 
 
 3.4 Relation between changes in functional connectivity and tutoring
gains 
 
 Changes in IPS, but not AG, connectivity are associated with arithmetic
performance gains 
 To investigate whether math tutoring-related changes in IPS and AG
functional connectivity were associated with performance improvements, we
examined the relation between changes in performance efficiency and changes
in functional connectivity. Functional connectivity values were extracted
from peaks of the cortical and subcortical clusters that showed math
tutoring-related changes in IPS and AG functional connectivity (see  Table S6 ). For the
IPS, connectivity with most of the ROIs was correlated with performance gain
( Figure 6A ;  Table 1 ). In contrast, changes in AG
connectivity were not correlated with performance improvements ( Figure 7 ,  Table 1 ). 
 In a previous study, we found that pre-tutoring volume within a
region in right hippocampus predicted individual performance gains
associated with tutoring ( Supekar et al.,
2013 ). We conducted additional exploratory analyses to examine
whether tutoring-related changes in IPS and AG connectivity with this right
hippocampus region were also correlated with performance gains. We found a
significant correlation with IPS-right hippocampus connectivity changes, but
not with AG-right hippocampus connectivity changes ( Figure 6B ;  Table
1 ). Taken together, these results suggest that alterations in IPS
circuits underlie math tutoring-related performance gains, highlighting the
behavioral significance of the connectivity changes. 
 
 
 
 3.5 Test-retest effects on functional connectivity 
 
 No changes in IPS and AG connectivity with target regions in comparison
group 
 To rule out test-retest effects, we examined functional connectivity
changes in a comparison group with children who did not take part in math
tutoring. We first performed an ROI analysis focusing on the peaks of the
cortical and subcortical clusters that showed functional connectivity
changes in the tutoring group (see  Table S6 ). In contrast to the tutoring group, the
comparison group did not show increased IPS or AG connectivity with any of
the target regions ( Table 2 ).
Crucially, changes in IPS and AG connectivity between Time 1 and Time 2 were
not correlated with changes in performance (all  p s
≥ .07). Next, we performed whole-brain paired
 t -tests of the IPS and AG separately, similar to the
analyses that were performed in the tutoring group. These analyses did not
reveal any significant increases of functional connectivity for IPS or AG.
The only connectivity change present in the comparison group was reduced IPS
connectivity with the posterior cingulate cortex ( Table S7 ). 
 
 
 
 
 4. Discussion 
 A key goal of our study was to investigate plasticity of intrinsic brain
circuits in relation to intensive cognitive tutoring in elementary school children
during an important developmental stage in math skill acquisition. The cognitive
tutoring program was designed to improve number knowledge and speeded retrieval of
arithmetic number combinations ( Fuchs et al.,
2013 ;  Fuchs et al., 2009 ) and
engage brain systems associated with representing and manipulating numerical
symbolic information. We used a network approach to examine plasticity of intrinsic
functional brain circuits, incorporating the emerging view that complex cognitive
tasks require the orchestrated activity of multiple brain areas ( Bressler & Menon, 2010 ). Because of the central
role of the IPS in numerical cognition, we hypothesized that tutoring would
strengthen its connectivity with a distributed network of brain regions ( Arsalidou & Taylor, 2011 ;  Menon, 2015a ) and that these changes would be
qualitatively different from those of the anatomically adjacent AG. Our study
revealed four key findings: (i) math tutoring with a specific focus on mental
arithmetic improved performance and strengthened IPS connectivity with VTOC regions
involved in higher order visual “object” processing, PFC regions
involved in attention and cognitive control, and MTL regions involved in declarative
memory; (ii) consistent with the interactive specialization hypothesis,
tutoring-related changes in IPS connectivity were largely distinct from those of the
adjacent AG; (iii) changes in IPS, but not AG, connectivity were correlated with
individual differences in performance gains associated with tutoring; and (iv) in a
comparison group of children who did not go through tutoring, IPS and AG
connectivity changes were largely absent and unrelated to changes in performance.
Taken together, our findings provide new insights into experience-dependent brain
connectivity changes and differentiation of parietal networks underlying math
learning. 
 
 Math tutoring strengthens intrinsic connectivity of the IPS 
 Children showed significantly stronger functional connectivity of the
IPS with multiple brain regions after tutoring, compared to before tutoring. The
IPS showed stronger functional connectivity with lingual and fusiform gyri in
the VTOC. The IPS and VTOC form part of the dorsal and ventral association areas
that process representations of numerical problems. Whereas the IPS supports
representations and manipulation of quantity, the VTOC supports perceptual
representations for visual number form ( Arsalidou
& Taylor, 2011 ;  Dehaene
& Cohen, 1995 ;  Holloway,
Battista, Vogel, & Ansari, 2013 ;  Lyons & Ansari, 2009 ). Furthermore, we found
increased functional connectivity between IPS and PFC regions, including IFG and
frontal pole, which are involved in domain-general cognitive control processes
that guide retrieval, inhibition of irrelevant facts, and maintenance of
information in working memory during the initial stages of skill acquisition
( Cho et al., 2012 ;  Rosenberg-Lee, Barth, et al., 2011 ;  Rosenberg-Lee et al., 2009 ). The increased and
regionally specific functional interactions among the IPS, VTOC, and PFC likely
support stronger integration of magnitude processing, symbol manipulation, and
cognitive control, three core components of mathematical cognition. 
 We also found increased functional connectivity between the IPS and the
hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus in the posterior and medial aspects of the
MTL. While the MTL has generally not been included in models of math cognition
in adults, MTL involvement has now been consistently demonstrated in recent
studies of children’s arithmetic development ( De Smedt, Holloway, & Ansari, 2011 ;  Rivera et al., 2005 ;  Rosenberg-Lee, Barth, et al., 2011 ). In particular,
longitudinal increases in the use of retrieval strategies have been linked to
MTL engagement ( Cho et al., 2012 ;  Cho, Ryali, Geary, & Menon, 2011 ;
 Qin et al., 2014 ). Furthermore,
hippocampal volume and functional connectivity are strong predictors of
performance improvements with math tutoring in children ( Supekar et al., 2013 ). These findings are consistent
with classical memory models proposing that the hippocampus plays a crucial role
in integrating information across distributed cortical modules during learning,
eventually leading to neocortical consolidation of facts ( Frankland & Bontempi, 2005 ;  Qin et al., 2014 ;  Smith & Squire, 2009 ;  Squire, Stark, & Clark, 2004 ;  Takashima et al., 2009 ;  Wang & Morris, 2010 ). 
 
 
 Differentiation and integration of IPS and AG systems with tutoring 
 The IPS and AG are adjacent subdivisions of the inferior parietal
cortex, but they have different patterns of intrinsic brain connectivity ( Uddin et al., 2010 ) and are thought to have
distinct roles in mathematical cognition ( Dehaene et al., 2003 ;  Dehaene et
al., 1999 ;  Menon, 2015a ). Here
we demonstrate that functional segregation of IPS and AG circuits is already
present in elementary school children. Before tutoring, compared to the AG, the
IPS was more strongly connected to the lateral fronto-parietal network,
including the posterior parietal cortex and lateral PFC. In contrast, the AG was
more strongly connected to regions encompassing the default mode network,
including the posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and medial PFC. We
hypothesized that math tutoring would result in differential changes in IPS- and
AG-related functional circuits. Specifically, we predicted that the IPS would
show larger connectivity changes with the fronto-parietal network, while the AG
would show larger connectivity changes with the MTL and other nodes of the
default mode network. This hypothesis was confirmed with respect to changes in
the fronto-parietal network. Specifically, the IPS showed stronger changes in
functional connectivity with the lateral PFC and VTOC. 
 Surprisingly, the IPS and AG showed similar levels of tutoring-related
connectivity changes in connectivity with the MTL (as indicated by similar
changes of beta values within the MTL;  Figure
4A ). Thus, the MTL appears to be a common locus of learning-related
changes in IPS and AG functional circuits, such that during learning this region
may aid in integration of signals from different subdivisions of the posterior
parietal cortex ( Menon, 2015a ). In
general, the commonalities between IPS- and AG-related connectivity changes are
in agreement with the proposal that IPS and AG circuits operate in an integrated
fashion during math cognition due to an interplay between magnitude-related
processing and verbally-mediated fact retrieval that occurs automatically
irrespective of task demands ( Klein, Moeller,
Glauche, Weiller, & Willmes, 2013 ;  Klein et al., 2014 ). Further research using
appropriate task paradigms is required to test this hypothesis and to examine
the role of IPS, AG, and MTL circuits in this process. 
 Taken together, our findings suggest that, with the exception of the
MTL, tutoring-related changes in IPS and AG functional connectivity are largely
distinct. These findings are consistent with the interactive specialization
hypothesis, which posits that learning contributes to the differentiation of
functional brain circuits ( Johnson,
2011 ). The anatomical specificity of learning-related circuit changes was
further illustrated by the absence of tutoring-related connectivity changes with
the right Heschl’s gyrus, a control seed-ROI that was not expected to be
affected by the tutoring protocol. 
 
 
 Tutoring-related changes in functional connectivity are behaviorally
relevant 
 Tutoring increased performance efficiency during arithmetic problem
solving. Importantly, improvements in performance were associated with
functional connectivity changes of the IPS. These findings are consistent with
our previous work showing a positive relation between tutoring-related
performance improvement and changes of white matter integrity in a subsection of
the left superior longitudinal fasciculus ( Jolles et al., 2015 ). Crucially, changes in AG functional
connectivity were not correlated with performance improvement, further
demonstrating differentiation between the functional roles of IPS and AG
circuits. Our findings may at first glance seem at odds with studies of math
learning in adults, which have reported specific engagement of the AG for
trained math problems, whereas activation of the IPS was stronger for untrained
math problems (Delazer et al., 2005; Ischebeck, Zamarian, Egger, Schocke,
& Delazer, 2007). However, recent studies have suggested that although
the AG shows higher levels of activation for trained versus untrained problems
post-training, when activation for trained problems was compared to activation
for the same problems in the pre-training session, no signal changes were
observed in the AG (Bloechle et al., 2016), suggesting that the AG is not
involved in fact retrieval per se. The observation that the AG is typically
deactivated on simple arithmetic tasks where retrieval fluency is high ( Rosenberg-Lee, Chang, et al., 2011 ;  Wu et al., 2009 ) provides further support
for the idea that the AG is not directly involved in the retrieval of arithmetic
facts. Our findings of brain-behavior correlations associated with the IPS but
not the AG are also consistent with this view. 
 The anatomical specificity of brain-behavior relations indicates that
changes in IPS connectivity with tutoring were not related to familiarity with
the scanning environment or developmental changes. To further investigate
test-retest effects, we examined a different cohort of third-grade children who
underwent the same scanning and testing procedures but did not take part in the
tutoring sessions. We did not find significant changes in functional
connectivity between the IPS (or AG) and the target regions in these children,
suggesting that the observed connectivity changes in the tutoring group were
specific to tutoring. Furthermore, individual differences in IPS and AG
connectivity were not correlated with performance changes in the comparison
group. These results further clarify the specificity of our findings relating
the IPS to behavioral changes associated with tutoring. 
 
 
 Future Directions 
 The present study is the first to investigate plasticity of parietal
brain circuits associated with the development of math skills in children.
Further studies using randomized controlled designs are needed to investigate
the generalizability of our findings in a larger group of well-matched
experimental and control participants, and to better disentangle the effects of
tutoring versus schooling and general development. Further studies are also
needed to quantify the relative efficacy of different tutoring designs and the
distinct functional circuits by which they enhance learning. Specifically, these
studies should characterize the behavioral effects and underlying neural
mechanisms of learning paradigms that focus on conceptual understanding and
magnitude representations (i.e. number sense) training versus rote-learning and
memorization of math facts. Such studies may help to further disentangle the
contribution of IPS and AG systems to math learning. 
 
 
 Conclusion 
 Our study demonstrates how intrinsic connectivity of specific
large-scale parietal circuits is reconfigured after 8 weeks of intensive math
tutoring in children and how these changes are related to individual differences
in children’s performance improvements. Tutoring-related increases in
IPS connectivity showed largely distinct patterns of change from those of the
adjacent AG, with an unexpected convergence in the MTL. Importantly, changes in
IPS, but not AG, connectivity were correlated with performance gains after math
tutoring. Our findings point to distinct but interactive roles of the IPS, AG,
and MTL in math cognition and learning. More generally, a better understanding
of brain circuit plasticity associated with learning may facilitate the
development of targeted intervention programs for children with learning
disabilities.

 Figure 1 
 
 Overall study design and performance improvement 
 ( A ) After the initial screening and standardized neuropsychological
testing, children came in for Time 1 math assessments and brain imaging,
including a resting-state fMRI scan. They then underwent an 8-week one-on-one
math tutoring program, which focused on conceptual as well as procedural
knowledge important to math skill development. After 8 weeks of tutoring,
children came back for the Time 2 math assessment and brain imaging session.
( B ) Increased performance efficiency after math tutoring.
Performance efficiency was measured using a composite of standardized accuracy
and response time (RT) scores on addition and subtraction tasks for each child
(N = 19). Error bars represent standard error of mean. *
 p  < .05. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 2 
 
 Parietal cortex IPS and AG seed ROIs 
 Regions of interest (ROIs) were defined based on unbiased observer-independent
cytoarchitectonic regions ( Caspers et al.,
2006 ,  2008 ;  Choi et al., 2006 ). AG = angular gyrus; IPS
= intraparietal sulcus. Coordinates are in MNI space. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 3 
 
 Differences in IPS and AG functional connectivity before (A) and after (B)
tutoring 
 Compared to the AG, the IPS showed stronger functional connectivity with
supramarginal gyrus and superior parietal lobule, lateral prefrontal cortex, and
ventral temporal occipital cortex. Compared to the IPS, the AG showed stronger
functional connectivity with posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, right AG,
lateral occipital cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex. AG = angular
gyrus; IPS = intraparietal sulcus. Coordinates are in MNI space. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 4 
 
 Math tutoring-related changes in IPS versus AG connectivity 
 ( A ) An ANOVA with Time (Time 1, Time 2) and Region (IPS, AG) as
factors revealed a main effect of Time in the left thalamus, posterior
hippocampus, and right lateral IFG. ( B ) Significant interaction
effects indicated that the IPS showed larger increases of functional
connectivity with bilateral PFC (frontal pole and MFG) and left VTOC
(temporo-occipital part of the inferior and middle temporal gyrus) compared to
the AG. AG showed greater connectivity increases with right pre/postcentral
gyrus and right occipital cortex relative to the IPS. Graphs show mean
connectivity levels (beta) in the peaks of each cluster. In panel A, mean
connectivity levels were also plotted for a subpeak in posterior hippocampus
(−22 −42 −2). Error bars represent standard error of
mean. AG = angular gyrus; MFG = middle frontal gyrus; MTG
= middle temporal gyrus; PFC = prefrontal cortex; IFG =
inferior frontal gyrus; IPS = intraparietal sulcus; STG =
superior temporal gyrus; VTOC = ventral temporal occipital cortex.
Coordinates are in MNI space. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 5 
 
 Tutoring-related changes in IPS and AG functional connectivity
separately 
 (A) Paired t-tests showed increased functional connectivity between the IPS and
the VTOC (right fusiform and left lingual gyri), lateral PFC (right IFG and
frontal pole), ventromedial PFC, MTL (left hippocampus and parahippocampal
gyrus), and left superior temporal gyrus with tutoring. ( B ) Paired
t-tests showed increased functional connectivity between the AG and right
pre/postcentral gyrus with tutoring. Graphs show mean connectivity levels (beta) in
the peaks of each cluster. Error bars represent standard error of mean. AG
= angular gyrus; IFG = inferior frontal gyrus; IPS =
intraparietal sulcus; MTL = medial temporal lobe; PFC =
prefrontal cortex; STG = superior temporal gyrus; VTOC = ventral
temporal occipital cortex. Coordinates are in MNI space. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 6 
 
 Tutoring-related performance gains were associated with changes in IPS
connectivity 
 ( A ) Increased performance efficiency was associated with
tutoring-related changes between IPS and fusiform gyrus, posterior hippocampus,
ventromedial PFC, and STG. ( B ) Performance gain was also associated
with increased connectivity between IPS and a region in right hippocampus that
has been shown to predict individual performance gains associated with tutoring.
FC = functional connectivity; IFG = inferior frontal gyrus; IPS
= intraparietal sulcus; PFC = prefrontal cortex; STG =
superior temporal gyrus; *  p  < .05;
**  p  < .01. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 7 
 
 Tutoring-related performance gains were not associated with changes in AG
connectivity 
 Increased performance efficiency was not associated with tutoring-related changes
between AG and right postcentral gyrus ( A ) or right hippocampus
( B ). Note that changes of AG connectivity with the peaks
derived from the IPS contrast (see  Table S6 ) were not significant either (all
 p ’s ≥ .288). FC = functional
connectivity.
