 The semi-acute phase of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is associated with deficits in the cognitive domains of attention, memory, and executive function, which previous work suggests may be related to a specific deficit in disengaging attentional focus. However, to date there have only been a few studies that have employed dynamic imaging techniques to investigate the potential neurological basis of these cognitive deficits during the semi-acute stage of injury. Therefore, event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) was used to investigate the neurological correlates of attentional dysfunction in a clinically homogeneous sample of 16 mTBI patients during the semi-acute phase of injury (< 3 weeks). Behaviorally, mTBI patients exhibited deficits in disengaging and reorienting auditory attention following invalid cues as well as a failure to inhibit attentional allocation to a cued spatial location compared to a group of matched controls. Accordingly, mTBI patients also exhibited hypoactivation within thalamus, striatum, midbrain nuclei and cerebellum across all trials as well as hypoactivation in the right posterior parietal cortex, pre-supplementary motor area, bilateral frontal eye fields and right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during attentional disengagement. Finally, the hemodynamic response within several regions of the attentional network predicted response times better for controls than mTBI patients. These objective neurological findings represent a potential biomarker for the behavioral deficits in spatial attention that characterize the initial recovery phase of mTBI.

 Introduction 
 Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) remains a poorly understood clinical phenomenon, despite lifetime incidence rates between 110 and 550 per 100,000 individuals ( Belanger et al., 2007 ;  Bigler, 2008 ). Meta-analyses indicate that mTBI is associated with subtle cognitive deficits (moderate effect sizes) during the semi-acute phase of injury, but that these deficits typically improve within 3-6 months ( Schretlen and Shapiro, 2003 ;  Belanger and Vanderploeg, 2005 ;  Belanger et al., 2005 ). Common deficits include problems with executive functioning, working memory and attention ( McAllister et al., 2006 ;  Belanger et al., 2007 ), all of which are mediated by distributed fronto-parietal circuits ( Cabeza and Nyberg, 2000 ). However, to date little is known about the putative neurobiological changes that may underlie this temporary disruption in cognitive functioning. Results from traditional neuroimaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are usually negative, indicating overt pathology in only 5-12% of cases ( Hughes et al., 2004 ;  Belanger et al., 2007 ;  Sturzenegger et al., 2008 ;  Topal et al., 2008 ) but see  Lee et al. (2008) . 
 Functional MRI (FMRI) offers great promise for elucidating the potential mechanisms causing cognitive deficits, given its capability for measuring the dynamic changes in neural functioning that characterize higher-order cognition ( McAllister et al., 2006 ;  Belanger et al., 2007 ). However, the majority of FMRI studies to date suffer from significant limitations, including substantial clinical heterogeneity in terms of both injury severity (e.g., sample consists of mild, moderate and severe TBI patients) and time post-injury (e.g., scan-time ranges from days to years post-injury), as well as small sample sizes (n < 8). This heterogeneity hampers analyses of pathology, given the very significant individual variation in recovery trajectories that characterizes different subgroups of TBI. Specifically, patients with moderate to severe TBI may take years to recover, or may never fully recover at all ( Thurman et al., 1999 ). In contrast, although mTBI patients usually exhibit some form of cognitive deficit for a few days to weeks post-injury, 80-95% of patients fully recover within the first 3-6 months of injury ( Schretlen and Shapiro, 2003 ;  Belanger et al., 2005 ;  Iverson, 2005 ;  Belanger et al., 2007 ;  Bigler, 2008 ). These clinical observations indicate the need for neuroimaging studies based on homogeneous samples (i.e., only mTBI patients) in the acute or semi-acute phase of injury (i.e., within several weeks post-injury) when cognitive deficits are expected, rather than months later when they are quite atypical. 
 The few FMRI studies on mTBI with adequate sample sizes (n > 8) have focused on working memory paradigms, with results suggesting a complex relationship between cognitive load and functional activation that is not easily characterized. In a series of studies on semi-acute (within 1 month of injury) mTBI patients,  McAllister et al. (1999)  reported hyperactivation in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and lateral parietal regions for mTBI patients compared to healthy controls (HC) for moderate processing loads (1 back to 2 back), but hypoactivation for the 0 to 1 back task. Additional work indicated that mTBI patients exhibited fronto-parietal hyperactivation going from the 1-back to 2-back condition, but hypoactivation going from 2 to 3 back ( McAllister et al., 2001 ). A more recent study reported a positive correlation between self-report measures of symptom severity and increased activation within the working memory network (e.g., dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex), as well as a correlation between hyperactivation outside of the traditional network and self-reported symptomatology ( Smits et al., 2008 ).Other working memory studies have examined concussed athletes within 3-6 months of injury. Results indicated hypoactivation in the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate gyrus for concussed individuals compared to healthy controls coupled with hyperactivation in temporal and parietal ( Chen et al., 2004 ;  Chen et al., 2007 ) lobes for the concussed group. The reduction in activation was also shown to be negatively related to scores on a post-concussion scale, suggesting that greater self-reported symptom severity predicts the magnitude of the BOLD response abnormality ( Chen et al., 2007 ). Finally, a recent study by the same group indicated that concussed athletes with depression exhibited hypoactivation within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and reduced  deactivation  during working memory in the anterior cingulate gyrus and temporal lobes compared to both controls and patients without depression ( Chen et al., 2008 ). 
 Only a few imaging studies have examined attentional or executive functioning in TBI ( Soeda et al., 2005 ;  Scheibel et al., 2007 ;  Turner and Levine, 2008 ;  Kim et al., 2008 ), with the majority of studies being limited to more severely injured populations. Similar to their results from the working memory paradigm, Smits and colleagues reported increased activation within the anterior cingulate gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, insula and posterior parietal areas with increased incidence of post-concussive symptoms ( Smits et al., 2008 ). Recent behavioral studies suggest that participants with TBI may experience difficulty with basic attentional processes such as eye movements ( Kraus et al., 2007 ) and spatial orienting ( Halterman et al., 2006 ;  Pavlovskaya et al., 2007 ;  Drew et al., 2007 ). For example, TBI patients experience greater difficulties making leftwards than rightwards shifts of spatial attention, a deficit that was ameliorated following treatment with methylphenidate ( Pavlovskaya et al., 2007 ). Other behavioral studies have demonstrated that both spatial orienting and gap saccades are typically impaired in the semi-acute stages of mTBI ( Halterman et al., 2006 ;  Drew et al., 2007 ), and that difficulties with disengagement, i.e. shifting attention from one focused target to another, might account for the majority of attentional deficits observed in this population. 
 A neuroimaging study examining bottom-up attentional orienting in mTBI could therefore offer important new information about the neuroanatomic substrate of the putative disengagement deficit (e.g., frontal or parietal lobes) and how it is related to observed deficits in behavioral performance. Several specific cognitive operations must occur in close temporal proximity for organisms to orient their attention and localize a target in extrapersonal space ( Corbetta et al., 2000 ;  Thiel et al., 2004 ;  Mayer et al., 2007 ). During valid trials (target appears in cued location), participants must first identify the cue, shift their attention to the cued location, identify the location of the target, and finally, respond with a button press. Invalid trials (target appears in uncued location) have the additional requirement of disengaging and reorienting attention to the target's new location. Therefore, when the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between the cue and target is less than 250 milliseconds, invalid trials are typically associated with longer response times and increased activation within the supplementary motor area (SMA), frontal eye fields (FEFs) and inferior parietal lobes (IPL) ( Arrington et al., 2000 ;  Corbetta et al., 2000 ;  Thiel et al., 2004 ;  Mayer et al., 2004a ;  Mayer et al., 2007 ). 
 At longer SOAs during bottom-up (i.e., exogenous) orienting, the relationship between valid and invalid trials typically inverts so that response times become faster for invalidly compared to validly cued trials (see  Figure 2B  for example). This reversal in reaction time has traditionally been called inhibition of return (IOR), and is believed to be either an evolutionary mechanism to promote novelty recognition in the spatial environment or an inhibitory mechanism to prevent repetitive eye movements. This reversal in behavioral data (i.e., slower reaction times for validly compared to invalidly cued trials) is frequently mirrored by an equalization or reversal in functional activation in frontal and parietal sites compared to the greater activation that is observed for invalidly cued trials during shorter SOAs ( Lepsien and Pollmann, 2002 ;  Mayer et al., 2007 ). 
 In the current experiment, we predicted that mTBI patients compared to controls would exhibit both greater reaction times for invalidly cued trials at the short SOA as well as hypoactivation in the disengagement network (SMA, FEF, & IPL) indicative of attentional failures. Likewise, we predicted that mTBI patients would fail to exhibit IOR for both the behavioral and functional data at longer SOAs. Finally, we predicted that the magnitude of activation within the inferior parietal lobes and frontal oculomotor sites would account for significant variance on behavioral measures of functioning for HC but not for mTBI patients. 
 
 
 Methods 
 
 Participants 
 Sixteen patients with mTBI (8 males, 8 females; 27.2 +/− 7.62 years old; 13.1 +/− 2.5 years of education) and sixteen gender, age and education matched controls (27.3 +/− 7.43 years old; 14.4 +/− 2.3 years of education) were recruited for the current study. There were no significant differences between groups ( p  > .10) on any of these major demographic variables or for hand preference as assessed by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldfield 1971). All mTBI patients experienced a closed head injury resulting in an alteration in mental status. Patients were evaluated both clinically (mean day post-injury = 11.47 +/− 5.34) and with brain imaging (mean day post-injury = 11.88 +/− 5.9) within 21 days of injury (see  Supplementary Table I ). One mTBI patient was not able to complete neuropsychological testing within 21 days of injury due to transportation difficulties. Additional inclusion criteria were based on the American Congress of Rehabilitory Medicine and included a Glasgow Coma Score of 13-15 (at presentation in the emergency room), loss of consciousness (if present) limited to 30 minutes in duration, and post-traumatic amnesia limited to a 24 hour period ( Bigler, 2008 ). Mild TBI participants and controls were excluded if there was a positive history of neurological disease, psychiatric disturbance, additional closed head injuries with more than 5 minutes loss of consciousness, learning disorder, ADHD or a history of substance or alcohol abuse. At the time of assessment, three of the mTBI subjects were being prescribed narcotic medications for pain 1 . Informed consent was obtained from subjects according to institutional guidelines at the University of New Mexico. 
 
 
 Clinical Assessment 
 To reduce redundancy amongst similar neuropsychological measures, composite indices were calculated for the following cognitive domains: attention (Trails A , Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test, Stroop (color-word and interference scores), and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition (WAIS-III) digit span), working memory (WAIS-III letter number sequence, arithmetic, and digits backward), processing speed (grooved pegboard (dominant and non-dominant hand) and WAIS-III digit symbol coding), executive function (Wisconsin Card Sort (errors and perseverative errors), Trails B, and Controlled Oral Word Association FAS-test), and memory (California Verbal Learning Test- Second Edition: immediate recall, short-delay free recall, long-delay free recall). Composite measures of emotional status (State-Trait Anxiety Index and Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition), somatic complaints (Neurobehavioral Symptom Checklist) and cognitive complaints (Neurobehavioral Symptom Checklist) were also assessed. Within each cognitive and psychological domain (with the exception of Neurobehavioral Symptom measures) the relevant test scores were converted to T-scores (mean = 50, SD = 10) using published age-specific norms and then averaged to provide an overall composite score. The Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR) was also used to provide an estimate of overall pre-morbid intellectual functioning. The Test of Memory and Malingering allowed assessment of participant effort and cooperation. Please see  Lezak et al. (2004)  for references to all tests. 
 
 
 Task 
 All participants completed a bottom-up auditory orienting task while undergoing FMRI on a 3.0 Tesla Siemens Trio scanner (see  Figure 1 ). Participants rested supine in the scanner with their head secured by a forehead strap, with additional foam padding to limit head motion within the head coil. Presentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems) was used for stimulus presentation, synchronization of stimulus events with the MRI scanner and recording of response times. A white visual fixation cross (visual angle = 1.02°) on a black background was rear-projected using a Sharp XG-C50X LCD projector onto an opaque white Plexiglas projection screen. 
 Auditory stimuli were presented with an Avotec Silent Scan 3100 Series System. The first tone pip (2000 Hz) served as a spatial cue that correctly (i.e., valid trials) predicted the location of a second target tone pip (1000 Hz) on 50% of the experimental trials (e.g., both cue and target occurred in right headphone). On the remainder of the trials the cue incorrectly (i.e., invalid trials) predicted target location (e.g., cue and target occurred in opposite headphones). To maximize bottom-up orienting effects, participants were informed that the cues did not contain any useful information about the location of the target prior to the start of the experiment. Both tones were sampled with a 10 ms linear onset-offset ramp to reduce the occurrence of clicks during auditory stimulus presentation. The SOA between the cue and the target was either 200 (facilitation) or 700 (IOR) ms, and SOA and trial-type (valid versus invalid) were randomly varied throughout the experiment. Participants were instructed to make a key press with their right middle finger for targets appearing in the right headphone and right index finger for targets appearing in the left headphone. There were a total of 84 valid (42 trials per SOA) and 84 invalid trials presented across three separate imaging runs. 
 The inter-trial interval randomly varied between 4, 6 or 8 s. These intervals were selected to both facilitate the sampling of the hemodynamic response ( Burock et al., 1998 ) and to minimize the likelihood of non-linear summing of hemodynamic responses, which has been demonstrated to occur at intervals of 3 s or less ( Glover, 1999 ). Participants were required to both practice the task and to demonstrate 100% proficiency in verbally identifying the cue compared to the target tone pips before entering the scanner environment. 
 
 
 MR Imaging 
 High resolution T1 [TE (echo time) = 1.64 ms, TR (repetition time) = 2.53 s, 7° flip angle, number of excitations (NEX) = 1, slice thickness = 1 mm, FOV (field of view) = 256 mm, resolution = 256 × 256] and T2 [TE = 77.0 ms, TR = 1.55 s, flip angle 152°, NEX = 1, slice thickness = 1.5 mm, FOV = 220 mm, matrix = 192×192, voxel size = 1.15×1.15×1.5 mm 3 ] anatomic images were collected on a 3 Tesla Siemens Trio scanner. For the three FMRI series, 162 echo-planar images were collected using a single-shot, gradient-echo echoplanar pulse sequence [TR = 2000 ms; TE = 29 ms; flip angle = 75°; FOV = 240 mm; matrix size = 64 × 64]. The first image of each run was eliminated to account for T1 equilibrium effects, leaving a total of 483 images for the final analyses. Thirty-three contiguous sagittal 3.5-mm thick slices with a gap factor of 1.05 mm were selected to provide whole-brain coverage (voxel size: 3.75 × 3.75 × 4.55 mm). 
 
 
 Image Processing and Statistical Analyses 
 Functional images were generated using Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI) software package ( Cox, 1996 ). Time series images were spatially registered in both two- and three-dimensional space to the second EPI image of the first run to minimize effects of head motion, temporally interpolated to correct for slice-time acquisition differences and de-spiked. A deconvolution analysis was then performed on a voxel-wise basis to generate one hemodynamic response function (HRF) for each of the four main conditions of interest (i.e., valid and invalid trials at each of the SOAs). In addition, participants’ motion parameters were entered as regressors of no interest to reduce the impact of head motion on patterns of functional activation. Each HRF was derived relative to the baseline state (visual fixation plus baseline gradient noise) and based on the first 16 seconds post-stimulus onset. The images acquired 4.0 to 8.0 seconds post-stimulus onset from the cue, corresponding to the peak of the hemodynamic response function ( Cohen, 1997 ), were then summed and divided by the model intercept to obtain an estimate of percent signal change. Anatomical and functional images were then interpolated to volumes with 1 mm 3  voxels, co-registered, converted to a standard stereotaxic coordinate space ( Talairach and Tournoux, 1988 ), and blurred using a 10 mm Gaussian full-width half-maximum filter. 
 A voxel-wise, 2 × 2 × 2 (Group × Validity × SOA) repeated measures ANOVA was then performed on the spatially normalized percent signal change measure. In addition, invalid and validly cued trials were directly compared within each group at both the 200 ms (attentional disengagement and reorienting) and 700 ms SOA to address our primary hypothesis. For all voxel-wise analyses, a significance threshold corresponding to  p  < .005 was applied in combination with a minimum cluster size threshold of .384 millilitres (6 native voxels) to minimize false positives, which resulted in a corrected p value of .05 based on 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations ( Forman et al., 1995 ). 
 
 
 
 Results 
 
 Neuropsychological and Clinical Measures 
 A compilation of all major neuropsychological and clinical indices are presented in  Table I . Independent samples t-tests were first conducted to examine group differences in effort (TOMM), estimates of premorbid levels of intelligence (WTAR), emotional functioning and severity of somatic and cognitive complaints. Results indicated a significant difference for the emotionality index (t 1,29  = 2.72,  p  < .05; mTBI > HC), with controls exhibiting lower than normal (composite T = 43.19) levels of depression and anxiety. In addition, mTBI patients also reported more cognitive (t 1,29  = 3.79;  p  < .005) and somatic (t 1,29  = 4.22;  p  < .001) complaints than controls. There were no significant differences in levels of effort ( p  > .10), and only a non-significant trend (t  1,29  = 1.97,  p  = .058; HC > mTBI) for estimated levels of premorbid intellectual functioning (WTAR). 
 The composite indices of attention, working memory, memory, processing speed and executive functioning were correlated to varying degrees (r's ranged from .17 to .71); therefore, a MANOVA was performed to examine group differences in the cognitive scores using the emotionality index as a covariate. The multivariate effect of group was not significant for the MANOVA ( p  > .10), although moderate or large effect sizes were observed in the domains of attention, executive functioning and memory. 
 
 
 Behavioral Data 
 Group-wise outlier analyses identified one normal control as an extreme outlier (plus three standard deviations) on a key behavioral measure (response time for orienting trials). This subject was subsequently discarded from all further behavioral and functional analyses. Separate 2 × 2 × 2 [Group × Validity × SOA] mixed-measures ANOVAs were then performed on the RT and accuracy data to evaluate performance in the scanning environment (see  Figure 2 ). The RT analyses showed a significant main effect of SOA (F 1,29  = 62.10,  p  < .001), a significant validity by SOA interaction (F 1,29  = 46.61,  p  < .001), a significant validity by group interaction (F 1,29  = 4.67,  p  < .05) and a non-significant trend for validity (F 1,29  = 3.83,  p  = .06). Follow-up paired t-tests indicated that the validity by SOA interaction was the result of significant reorienting effects (invalid > valid; t 1,30  = −4.52,  p  < .001) at the 200 ms SOA compared to a non-significant trend for IOR (valid> invalid; t 1,30  = 1.98,  p  = .057) at the 700 ms SOA. 
 However, follow-up of the validity by group interaction demonstrated that these patterns also varied by group. Specifically, there was no significant difference ( p  > .10) between valid (mean = 565.63 ms) and invalid (mean = 562.89 ms) trials for HC when trials were collapsed across SOA, due to the cancelling effects of facilitation and IOR at the different SOAs. In contrast, TBI patients exhibited greater reaction times for invalid (mean = 602.71 ms) compared to valid (mean = 546.98 ms) trials when trials were collapsed across SOA (t 1,15  = 2.3,  p  < .05). This general pattern was further elucidated by tests of our predicted hypotheses. Specifically, there was a non-significant trend indicating greater costs of reorienting (valid-invalid) at the 200 ms SOA (t 1,29  = 1.71,  p  = .098) as well as a significant reduction in IOR (t 1,29  = 2.08,  p  < .05) at 700 ms for mTBI patients compared to HC (see  Figure 2C ). 
 An identical 2×2×2 ANOVA indicated a significant main effect for validity (F 1,29  = 9.25,  p  < .01) and a non-significant trend for validity by SOA (F 1,29  = 3.12,  p  = .088). Examination of means indicated that performance was better on valid (mean accuracy = 97.33%) compared to invalid (mean accuracy = 93.5%) trials. However, behavioral accuracy for the task was very high across both groups of participants (mTBI = 95.13 +/− .06%; HC = 95.71 +/− .06%). 
 
 
 Structural Imaging Data 
 Anatomical images (T1 and T2) were read by a board-certified neuroradiologist and found to be free of trauma related pathology (i.e., all mTBI patients were non-complicated). 
 
 
 Functional Imaging Data 
 Two MANOVAs were first conducted to investigate any potential differences in head motion (both rotational and translational displacements in image space) across the two groups, which could serve as a potential confound for the interpretation of FMRI data. The dependent variables for these analyses corresponded to a summation of the absolute difference in head motion parameters across successive images. However, the multivariate effect of group was not significant ( p  > .10) for either of the MANOVAs. 
 Similar to the behavioral data, a 2×2×2 mixed-measures ANOVA (Group × Validity × SOA) was conducted on the percent signal change data obtained from each trial type. In general, the results from the non-group effects (effect of SOA, validity and SOA × validity interaction) were very similar to previously published results in a healthy population ( Mayer et al., 2007 ). Several clusters demonstrated main effects of either validity or SOA and were not implicated in the SOA × validity interaction. Specifically, increased activation during invalid trials was observed in the left inferior gyrus (BAs 45/47), left middle frontal and precentral gyrus (BAs 6/9), left caudate extending into the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, bilateral red nuclei and right medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus (see  Supplementary Table II ). There were no areas that demonstrated greater activation during validly cued trials. 
 Increased activation during the 700 ms compared to 200 ms SOA trials was observed within the bilateral precentral and middle frontal gyri (BA 6) corresponding to the frontal eye fields, the left cingulate and medial frontal gyri (BAs 6/24), the right precuneus (BA 7), and bilateral auditory cortical areas (BAs 13/22/41/42) extending into the inferior parietal cortex (see  Supplementary Table III ). Conversely, activation was greater for 200 ms trials within the left inferior frontal gyrus/anterior insula (BAs 13/47), bilateral anterior cingulate gyrus (BAs 24/33), right inferior parietal lobule (BA 40) and in the bilateral vermis. 
 Several regions exhibited a significant validity by SOA interaction which could be further characterized by two distinct patterns (see  Figure 3 ;  Table II ). Specifically, several regions demonstrated patterns of activation that closely resembled the behavioral data in which activation for invalidly cued trials was greater (invalid > valid) at the 200ms SOA followed by a reversal in this pattern (valid > invalid) at the 700ms SOA. These areas included left superior and middle temporal gyri, bilateral posterior parietal cortex, right cuneus (BA 19), and right cerebellar tonsil. The second pattern of activation was associated with greater activation for invalid trials at the 200 ms SOA and included the bilateral medial frontal cortex (BAs 6/32), bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex extending into the anterior insula (BAs 45/13), left precentral and middle frontal gyrus (BAs 4/6) corresponding to the frontal eye field (Paus, 1996), right middle and superior temporal gyri (BA 21/22), and left thalamic and midbrain nuclei. 
 In terms of the main effect of group (see  Figure 4 ;  Table III ), results indicated decreased activation (i.e., hypoactivation) for mTBI patients relative to controls within the bilateral posterior cingulate gyrus (BAs 23/29), bilateral pons and midbrain nuclei, bilateral culmen and declive, bilateral medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus and the bilateral rostral basal ganglia. 
 Significant group by validity interactions were observed within the left superior frontal (BA 9; center of mass X = −7, Y = 45, Z = 27; .669 ml) and right superior temporal (BA 38; center of mass X = 22, Y = 9, Z = −30; .712 ml) gyrus. Follow-up t-tests revealed that there were no significant group differences for either valid or invalid trials, but that the patterns of activation did differ within each group. Specifically, HC and mTBI patients exhibited activation within the right superior temporal gyrus and deactivation in the left medial/superior frontal gyri (BA 9), however the magnitude was greater for mTBI in both regions for invalid compared to valid trials, while HC showed an opposite pattern of activation, with greater percent signal change occurring during valid trials. 
 Finally, a group by validity by SOA interaction effect was observed within the left inferior and middle temporal gyri (BAs 21/37; center of mass X = −58, Y = −54, Z = −1; .485 ml). To further dissect this 3-way interaction, two 2×2 (Group × Validity) ANOVAs were conducted separately for each SOA. Results indicated that the group by validity interaction was significant at both SOAs (no main effects), which was the result of HC, but not mTBI patients, exhibiting both reorienting (i.e invalid > valid at 200ms) and inhibitory (valid > invalid at 700ms) effects during functional activation. 
 In our next set of functional analyses, direct estimates of disengagement/reorienting (200 ms SOA) and IOR (700 ms SOA) were obtained for each group separately by comparing invalid and validly cued trials at each SOA. For both groups, there were no clusters that survived the false positive correction ( p  < .005; .384 millilitres) at the 700 ms SOA. In contrast, a large network of cortical and subcortical areas, which closely corresponded to the network identified in the SOA × validity interaction, exhibited greater activation for invalidly cued trials during disengagement and attentional reorienting (200 ms SOA) for HC but not for mTBI patients (see  Figure 5 ). Specifically, the only areas of overlap (see  Tables IV  and  V , starred text) between the two groups included the bilateral anterior insula (BA 13), right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (BAs 45/47), left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 9), and left posterior parietal lobules (BAs 40/7). However, for all of these clusters, the volume of activation was severely reduced in the mTBI group. In addition, HC exhibited widespread unique activation during attentional disengagement and reorienting (invalid > valid) within the bilateral pre-SMA and cingulate gyrus (BAs 6/24/31/32), bilateral frontal eye field areas (BA 6), right posterior parietal lobes (BAs 7/39/40), bilateral striatum, bilateral thalamus, and bilateral cerebellum as well as increased spatial activation of the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex compared to mTBI ( Table IV ). Several clusters of unique activation were also observed within the bilateral temporal lobe and left cuneus for HC but not mTBI patients. In contrast, only a single cluster within the bilateral midbrain and anterior thalamic nuclei exhibited activation unique for mTBI subjects (invalid > valid; see  Table V ). 
 The final analyses examined which of the clusters from the validity by SOA interaction were capable of predicting significant variance in behavioral performance on the orienting task. Specifically, two hierarchical backwards multiple regressions were conducted in which the validity by SOA clusters served as the independent variables and the reaction time data served as the dependent variable separately for each group. The analyses included subject specific random effects to account for repeated measures on each individual. The validity by SOA interaction map was adopted as the ROI network for these analyses as it was calculated based on data from both groups of subjects (e.g., unbiased) and closely resembled the classic fronto-parietal network that has been reported in previous studies of attentional orienting ( Corbetta and Shulman, 1998 ;  Thiel et al., 2004 ;  Mayer et al., 2007 ). In healthy controls, a network including the left posterior parietal cortex (t 1,40  = −2.19,  p  < 0.05), bilateral medial frontal cortex (t 1,40  = 4.54,  p  < 0.0001), left (t 1,40  = −1.8,  p  = 0.079) and right (t 1,40  = −4.47,  p  < 0.0001) middle and superior temporal gyrus and right cuneus (t 1,40  = 2.51,  p  < 0.05) predicted response time data (overall model F 5,40  = 7.38,  p  <. 0001). In contrast, only the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex/anterior insula (t 1,46  = 5.52,  p  < .0001) and right middle/superior temporal gyrus (t 1,46  = −1.79,  p  = 0.081) predicted response time data for mTBI patients (overall model F 2,46  = 15.85,  p  <. 0001). 
 
 
 
 Discussion 
 To our knowledge, this is the first FMRI study to examine attentional dysfunction in a clinically homogeneous sample of non-complicated mTBI patients during the semi-acute phase of injury when cognitive deficits are likely to be present ( Belanger et al., 2007 ;  Bigler, 2008 ). Before examining the findings related to the patient group, we first briefly discuss the most relevant behavioral and imaging results from the healthy controls. In general, healthy participants exhibited both increased reaction times and increased functional activity within a distributed fronto-parietal network for invalidly compared to validly cued 200 ms SOA trials. These behavioral and functional “costs” correspond to the active disengagement and reorienting of auditory attention following an invalid trial ( Posner et al., 1985 ;  Mayer et al., 2007 ). In contrast, response times were faster for invalidly rather than validly cued trials at the 700 ms SOA (i.e., inhibition of return), and activation within the fronto-parietal network was either equated or in some cases, such as the posterior parietal cortex, reversed. Current behavioral and functional results are generally consistent with previous studies on bottom-up orienting in both the auditory and visual modality ( Lepsien and Pollmann, 2002 ;  Mayer et al., 2004b ;  Mayer et al., 2007 ), and support the notion of redundancy within the attentional system ( Mesulam, 1990 ). 
 Several important differences in clinical, behavioral and functional measures were also observed between mTBI and HC groups. In terms of overall functioning, mTBI patients reported significantly more cognitive problems on a self-report checklist compared to the matched controls. Although the magnitude of deficits on traditional neuropsychological measures were not sufficient to reach conventional levels of statistical significance, the effect sizes (moderate to large) were consistent with previous meta-analyses suggesting subtle cognitive deficits for this population ( Schretlen and Shapiro, 2003 ;  Belanger and Vanderploeg, 2005 ;  Belanger et al., 2005 ). Mild TBI patients also scored significantly higher than controls on several self-report measures of emotional distress (primarily depression and anxiety) and somatic complaints. However, it is noteworthy that scores on normative measures of depression (Beck Depression Inventory) and anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) were within the normal range (composite T score = 50.33) for the patient group, suggesting that overt psychopathology is not a compelling explanation for either the behavioral deficits or functional differences described below. 
 Previous behavioral studies have demonstrated that both visual-spatial orienting and gap saccades are typically impaired in the semi-acute stages of mTBI ( Cremona-Meteyard and Geffen, 1994 ;  Van Donkelaar et al., 2005 ;  Halterman et al., 2006 ;  Drew et al., 2007 ), whereas more severely injured populations are both generally slower to identify targets during top-down orienting ( Bate et al., 2001 ) and exhibit deficits in engaging attentional focus (i.e., cueing benefits) ( Cremona-Meteyard et al., 1992 ). Current findings suggest that mTBI patients exhibited a deficit in disengaging their attention following an invalid cue (e.g., greater costs) at the shorter SOA, as well as a failure to inhibit attentional allocation to a cued spatial location (e.g., inhibition of return) at the longer SOA relative to controls. Although previous studies suggest that orienting deficits typically normalize within 1 week of injury ( Van Donkelaar et al., 2005 ;  Halterman et al., 2006 ), the post-injury scanning time (mean = 11.9 +/− 5.9 days) indicates that orienting deficits likely persisted beyond this window in the current sample. This discrepancy may be the result of sample characteristics as previous work ( Van Donkelaar et al., 2005 ;  Halterman et al., 2006 ) excluded college students who had experienced a loss of consciousness (i.e., American Academy of Neurology Grade III concussions). In contrast, the current sample was recruited from a local hospital and the majority of patients (87.5%) experienced a grade III concussion according to both self-report and hospital records. Collectively, current and previous results suggest that the grade of the mTBI may partially determine how quickly orienting deficits ameliorate following mTBI. 
 These behavioral findings provide a clinical measurement for the self-reported attentional deficits that are so frequently observed within the first few weeks of mTBI ( Iverson, 2005 ;  Belanger et al., 2007 ;  Bigler, 2008 ). Specifically, mTBI patients may have difficulty quickly reallocating their attention to detect new threats within their environment, which may have important implications for returning to work, engaging in hazardous activities, and driving. Importantly, mTBI patients’ behavioral deficits were associated with two different findings of functional abnormalities, and there were fewer regions of the core attention network that predicted response time data in patients compared to controls. The first major finding indicated that mTBI patients demonstrated hypoactivation within the bilateral striatum, medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus, pons, midbrain nuclei and cerebellum. All of these structures have previously been implicated in the orienting and maintenance of spatial attention. For example, behavioral work suggests a direct link between cerebellar hypoplasia and slower attentional shifts in autistic children ( Harris et al., 1999 ). Neuroimaging studies in healthy controls have reported cerebellar activation during sound discrimination ( Belin et al., 2002 ), spatial localization ( Zatorre et al., 2002 ), as well as auditory reorienting and IOR ( Mayer et al., 2007 ;  Salmi et al., 2007 ), indicating the large role that this structure plays in various forms of auditory attention. Similarly, lesion ( Rafal and Posner, 1987 ;  Arend et al., 2008 ) and more recent neuroimaging studies ( Salmi et al., 2007 ) suggest that the thalamus plays a crucial role in directing spatial attention. Finally, the cluster of hypoactivation within the medial pons roughly corresponds to auditory brainstem regions including the superior olivary complex ( Hesselmann et al., 2001 ), which was also shown to be more active for invalid compared to valid trials (main effect of validity). Collectively, these results suggest a general failure for mTBI patients to recruit the neuronal structures necessary to efficiently perform an orienting task across all trial types. 
 Our second major finding indicated that mTBI patients also exhibited hypoactivation within the traditional attentional network at the 200 ms SOA when disengagement demands were the greatest. Previous work suggests that the disengagement and reorienting of attentional focus is largely mediated by a distributed network comprised of frontal oculomotor sites, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and the posterior parietal lobe ( Arrington et al., 2000 ;  Corbetta et al., 2000 ;  Thiel et al., 2004 ;  Mayer et al., 2008 ). In contrast to healthy controls, mTBI patients failed to show the expected pattern of increased activation (invalid > valid) during attentional disengagement within right posterior parietal cortex, pre-SMA, bilateral FEF, right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, thalamic, midbrain nuclei and cerebellum. In addition, the volume of activation within the left posterior parietal cortex, bilateral insula and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex was also greatly reduced for mTBI patients. These findings corroborate the notion that the disengagement of attentional focus may be one of the primary behavioral deficits in mTBI during the initial recovery phase ( Halterman et al., 2006 ;  Drew et al., 2007 ), and further suggest that hypoactivation within the core attentional network may provide a potential biomarker of cognitive dysfunction during the semi-acute stage. Further evidence of this comes from our hierarchical regression analyses, which demonstrated that only the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and right middle/superior temporal gyrus accounted for significant behavioral variance mTBI patients. In contrast, a much broader network that included the left posterior parietal cortex, bilateral medial frontal gyrus, bilateral middle/superior temporal gyrus and right cuneus accounted for significant variance amongst the healthy controls. These results suggest a potential disconnect between the neuronal circuitry mediating attentional orienting and observed behavioral performance in mTBI patients. 
 As noted in the introduction, previous neuroimaging studies have reported a mixed pattern of both hypo- and hyperactivation in mTBI and more severely injured patients. Specifically, McAllister and colleagues reported hypoactivation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during lower levels of cognitive effort followed by hyperactivation in similar areas during more moderate cognitive loads during a working memory task ( McAllister et al., 1999 ;  McAllister et al., 2001 ). Smits reported hyperactivation during both a working memory and attention task in mTBI patients with more severe post-concussive symptoms ( Smits et al., 2008 ). Chen and colleagues reported hypoactivation for mTBI patients within both the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate gyrus coupled with hyperactivation in temporal and parietal cortices ( Chen et al., 2004 ;  Chen et al., 2007 ). More severely injured patients exhibit hypoactivation within the anterior cingulate during both the Stroop task ( Soeda et al., 2005 ) and visual orienting ( Kim et al., 1999 ), although hyperactivation within the right middle frontal gyrus, insula and left temporal cortex was also observed in the latter task ( Kim et al., 1999 ). Therefore, the largest difference between current and previous functional imaging studies seems to be the more consistent finding of hypoactivation across two separate networks in the current study. 
 The pattern of hypoactivation observed in the mTBI patients may be the result of impaired neuronal function, impaired neural control of microvessels, direct damage to the vascular system, a result of metabolic disruptions, or a combination of all of the above. For example, frank neuronal dysfunction (e.g., reduced mass-action of neuronal spikings) could result in a reduced BOLD effect by reducing the demand for hemodynamically delivered resources to restore cell homeostasis following increased metabolic demands ( Logothetis, 2008 ). Indirect support for this hypothesis comes from findings of reduced concentration of glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, in supraventricular gray matter in a similar sample of semi-acute mTBI patients during magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( Gasparovic et al., 2009 ). Likewise, other MRS studies on mTBI have also reported neurometabolic abnormalities in white matter voxels suggestive of direct damage to pathways ( Govindaraju et al., 2004 ;  Vagnozzi et al., 2008 ), which has also been generally supported by findings from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies ( Miles et al., 2008 ;  Niogi et al., 2008 ). 
 In addition, mTBI typically produces mechanical forces which could directly impact on the vasculature that underlies the BOLD response. For example, severe TBI significantly reduces cerebral blood flow and transit time ( Hillary and Biswal, 2007 ). In mTBI, increased Virchow-Robin spaces have been observed which may have been the result of an inflammatory process ( Inglese et al., 2005 ). Hemosiderin depositions, secondary to microhemorrhages and inflammation, have also been noted in the autopsy report of a mTBI patient who died seven months post-injury ( Bigler, 2004 ). In addition, animal studies based on the fluid percussion model indicate a semi-acute reduction in capillary number and diameter at two different levels of injury severity ( Park et al., 2009 ). Furthermore,  Ueda et al. (2006)  reported that TBI resulted in prolonged increases in reactivity of smooth muscle in the walls of microvessels. At present, it would be inappropriate to draw conclusions about the relative importance of these different mechanisms as they pertain to our finding of hypoactivation in a human clinical sample. Specifically, the BOLD response is an indirect measure of neuronal functioning whose basic signal properties are determined by cerebral blood flow, blood volume and the ratio of deoxyhemoglobin to oxyhemoglobin ( Logothetis, 2008 ), rendering an accurate assessment of potential mechanisms of neuropathology speculative at best. However, longitudinal multimodal studies of mTBI may provide a window on the temporal emergence and resolution of these abnormalities, providing unique insights as to their functional significance and impact on the BOLD response. 
 Several other potential explanations for the differences in the pattern of activation across these studies may exist. First, unlike previous studies ( McAllister et al., 1999 ;  McAllister et al., 2001 ;  Chen et al., 2004 ;  Chen et al., 2007 ), mTBI patients exhibited behavioral deficits during the orienting task, which may have biased the functional results towards an overall pattern of functional hypoactivation due to a failure to recruit appropriate neuronal resources. Second, the discrepancies in behavioral findings across studies might partially be the result of injury acuity (e.g., the majority of patients in Chen studies were several months post-injury) or due to differences in task selection. Specifically, the orienting task maximized the attentional disengagement deficit ( Halterman et al., 2006 ;  Drew et al., 2007 ) compared to previous FMRI studies which utilized working memory paradigms ( McAllister et al., 1999 ;  McAllister et al., 2001 ;  Chen et al., 2004 ;  Chen et al., 2007 ). Similarly, the reflexive and automatic nature (e.g., less effortful) of the bottom-up orienting task may have also contributed to the consistent pattern of hypoactivation observed in the current study. The level of effort required to perform the current task is likely to be more consistent with a lower cognitive load, which also resulted in hypoactivation for mTBI patients in previous work ( McAllister et al., 1999 ;  McAllister et al., 2001 ). Future studies should determine if a mixed pattern of hypo- and hyperactivation for mTBI patients would be observed during a top-down orienting task that involves more effortful shifts of attentional focus. 
 In conclusion, current results demonstrate both behavioral and functional deficits in bottom-up spatial orienting in semi-acute mTBI patients. These and previous ( Govindaraju et al., 2004 ;  Inglese et al., 2005 ;  Vagnozzi et al., 2008 ) findings suggest that magnetic resonance-based techniques such as FMRI, MRS and DTI show great promise for elucidating potential mechanisms of neuropathology in mTBI compared to more traditional imaging techniques (computed tomography scans and T1 and T2 weighted images). However, of these techniques only FMRI is capable of measuring the underlying neural response to dynamic cognitive challenges that are so often reported to be problematic within this population. Future FMRI studies should determine whether these behavioral and functional deficits normalize in conjunction with recovery, which is expected to spontaneously occur in the majority of mTBI patients ( Iverson, 2005 ;  Belanger et al., 2007 ;  Bigler, 2008 ). For example, activation within the frontal and parietal lobes has been shown to normalize as a function of recovery in more severely injured populations ( Sanchez-Carrion et al., 2008 ;  Kim et al., 2008 ), which is also likely to occur in mTBI in the first few months post-injury.

 There were no differences in the functional activation group effects when these subjects and their controls were removed from analyses. Although behavioral differences in both facilitation and IOR were no longer significant, this appeared to be more related to a loss of power as the effect sizes remained largely unchanged (facilitation d = .62 to .59; IOR d = .75 to .57).

 Figures and Tables 
 
 Figure 1 
 
 This figure is a diagrammatic representation of the auditory orienting task. Headphones were used to present a 2000-Hz pure tone (cue) followed by a 1000-Hz tone (target). Cues correctly predicted the target location (valid trials) on half of the trials. The stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between cues and targets was either 200 or 700 milliseconds (ms). Participants responded to the target location by pressing a button with their right index (left target) or middle (right target) finger. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 2 
 
 Graphs A and B depict reaction time (RT) in milliseconds (ms) for mild traumatic brain injury patients (mTBI: Panel A) and healthy controls (HC: Panel B) for valid and invalid trials at both 200 and 700 ms stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA). Panel C depicts difference scores between invalid and valid trials for HC (white bars) and mTBI patients (dark grey bars) at the 200 ms (facilitation; FAC) and 700 ms (inhibition of response; IOR) SOA. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 3 
 
 This figure depicts the regions exhibiting the validity by stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) interaction. Panel A shows the regions implicated in the interaction with axial (z) slice locations provided according to the Talairach atlas (L= left and R = right). Panel B presents clusters that demonstrated increased percent signal change (PSC) for invalid (I200; solid blue bars) compared to valid (V200; solid red bars)) trials at the 200 ms stimulus onset asynchrony (facilitation), as well as increased PSC for valid (V700; striped red bars) compared to invalid (I700; striped blue bars) trials at the 700 ms SOA (inhibition of return). These clusters included the 1) left and 2) right posterior parietal cortex and the 3) right cerebellum (not pictured in Panel A). Panel C includes the 4) left and 5) right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior insula, 6) bilateral medial frontal cortex, 7) left frontal eye field and 8) left thalamic and midbrain nuclei, which demonstrated increased PSC for invalid compared to valid trials at the 200 ms SOA only. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 4 
 
 This figure presents the clusters exhibiting significant group differences across all task conditions and the percent signal change (PSC) values for healthy controls (HC; white bars) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI; dark grey bars). Clusters include the 1) right and 2) left striatum, 3) pons and midbrain nuclei, 4) cerebellum, 5) posterior cingulate gyrus and 6) medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus. The locations of axial (z) and sagittal (x) slices are given according to the Talairach atlas (L= left and R = right). 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 5 
 
 This figure presents the within group comparisons of invalid and valid trials at 200ms stimulus onset asynchrony for healthy controls (HC: Panel A) and mild traumatic brain injury patients (mTBI: Panel B). Results indicated robust activation during attentional disengagement within the frontal eye fields (FEF), posterior parietal lobule (PPL), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), anterior insula (aINS), pre-supplementary motor area (p-SMA), and midbrain nuclei (MDB) for controls which was either absent or greatly reduced for mTBI patients. The locations of axial (z) and sagittal (x) slices are given according to the Talairach atlas (L= left and R = right).
