Fluid intelligence ( g f ) influences performance across many cognitive domains. It is affected by both genetic and environmental factors. Tasks tapping  g f  activate a network of brain regions including the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), the presupplementary motor area/anterior cingulate cortex (pre-SMA/ACC), and the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). In line with the “intermediate phenotype” approach, we assessed effects of a polymorphism ( val 158 met ) in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene on activity within this network and on actual task performance during spatial and verbal  g f  tasks. COMT regulates catecholaminergic signaling in prefrontal cortex. The  val 158  allele is associated with higher COMT activity than the  met 158  allele. Twenty-two volunteers genotyped for the COMT  val 158 met  polymorphism completed high and low  g f  versions of spatial and verbal problem-solving tasks. Our results showed a positive effect of COMT  val  allele load upon the blood oxygen level–dependent response in LPFC, pre-SMA/ACC, and IPS during high  g f  versus low  g f  task performance in both spatial and verbal domains. These results indicate an influence of the COMT  val 158 met  polymorphism upon the neural circuitry supporting  g f . The behavioral effects of  val  allele load differed inside and outside the scanner, consistent with contextual modulation of the relation between COMT  val 158 met  genotype and  g f  task performance. COMT fMRI g genotype intelligence prefrontal cortex Introduction Fluid intelligence ( g f ) is a major dimension of individual differences in cognitive function. Commonly measured by tests of reasoning and novel problem solving ( Cattell 1971 ),  g f  is conceptually distinct from crystallized intelligence ( g c ), which represents acquired knowledge and skill, and highly related to the psychometrically defined construct “ g ” ( Spearman 1927 ), the primary or “general” cognitive factor underlying the observation that the same individuals tend to do well across many different cognitive tasks. A strong predictor of achievement in educational and other domains, at a mechanistic level,  g f  has been linked to processes ranging from cognitive flexibility and strategy development to manipulation of stored mental representations and attentional control, in particular, the inhibition of interference ( Kane et al. 2005 ). There has been much interest in the extent to which genetic factors influence  g f . Heritability studies suggest that  g f  is strongly influenced by genetic as well as environmental factors, with genetic influences accounting for 40% or more of the variance in  g f  scores ( Gray and Thompson 2004 ). Despite its high heritability, attempts to identify specific genetic contributions to  g f  have made relatively little progress. Advances in functional genomics and neuroimaging now enable us to adopt an “intermediate phenotype” approach, examining genetic contributions to variability not in behavior itself but in the underlying neural mechanisms. It has been argued that genetic influences may be clearer at the neurophysiological level as measured by the blood oxygen level–dependent (BOLD) signal in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) than at the level of behavior. The former is held to be closer to the neurobiological effects of the gene and less susceptible to the sources of noise that can influence behavioral performance, increasing the likelihood of detecting the effects of single genetic polymorphisms ( Hariri and Weinberger 2003 ;  Goldberg and Weinberger 2004 ). In addition to increasing sensitivity to gene effects, this intermediate phenotype approach has the potential to provide new insights into the neurochemical mechanisms that support  g f , and may open a pathway to investigating how environmental factors also modulate the operation of these mechanisms. During performance of tasks with high  g f  loadings, conspicuous activity is seen in the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) ( Prabhakaran et al. 1997 ;  Duncan et al. 2000 ). Given this, a  val 158 met  polymorphism in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene is a striking candidate for influencing  g f -related neural function. COMT metabolizes released dopamine (DA). It is thought to be particularly critical to regulating DA signaling in the prefrontal cortex due to the scarcity of DA transporter in this region ( Sesack et al. 1998 ). The COMT  val 158  allele is associated with higher enzymatic activity than the less stable  met  allele, with heterozygous individuals showing intermediate enzyme activity ( Lotta et al. 1995 ;  Weinshilboum et al. 1999 ;  Chen et al. 2004 ). Though a number of other single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the COMT gene have also been identified ( Bray et al. 2003 ;  Chen et al. 2004 ), the  val 158 met  polymorphism is the only one to have been reliably shown to impact significantly upon COMT activity across both postmortem human dorsolateral prefrontal tissue samples and lymphoblast cultures ( Chen et al. 2004 ). Haplotype analyses conducted within the context of these studies have also reported no effects on COMT activity other than those attributable to the  val 158 met  polymorphism ( Chen et al. 2004 ). Although recent findings suggest that it may be premature to rule out more complex effects of genetic variation in COMT upon human LPFC function ( Meyer-Lindenberg et al. 2006 ;  Tunbridge et al. 2006 ), the  val 158 met  polymorphism is the strongest single candidate variant in the COMT gene for modulating LPFC function, providing a focus for genomic imaging studies where sample sizes may not easily allow for haplotype analyses. In line with this, a number of neuroimaging studies have examined the impact of the COMT  val 158 met  polymorphism upon LPFC activity, reporting that the number of  val  alleles possessed correlates positively with LPFC activity during performance of cognitive tasks including measures of working memory (WM), encoding, and retrieval ( Egan et al. 2001 ;  Bertolino, Blasi, et al. 2006 ,  Bertolino, Rubino, et al. 2006 ;  Schott et al. 2006 ). In contrast to the consistency of these results, findings from investigations of the impact of the COMT  val 158 met  polymorphism upon behavioral indices of cognition have been more variable ( Egan et al. 2001 ;  Bilder et al. 2004 ;  Diamond et al. 2004 ;  Nolan et al. 2004 ;  Tunbridge et al. 2006 ;  Barnett et al. 2007 ). It is possible that both state factors, such as the stressfulness of the current environment and the nature of the task performed might influence whether a  met  or  val  behavioral performance advantage is observed ( Bilder et al. 2004 ;  Tunbridge et al. 2006 ). Alternatively, the variability in behavioral results could simply reflect difficulty in reliably detecting effects of single genetic polymorphisms at the behavioral level of analysis. Given these considerations, we were interested in investigating the impact of the COMT  val 158 met  polymorphism upon  g f  task performance and associated neural activity. In particular, we were interested in whether, as proponents of the intermediate phenotype approach have argued ( Hariri and Weinberger 2003 ;  Goldberg and Weinberger 2004 ), the effects of single genetic variants such as the COMT  val 158 met  polymorphism might be more apparent upon  g f -related neural activity than upon  g f  task performance. A number of studies have suggested that performance of tasks with high  g f  loadings does not activate LPFC alone but recruits a circumscribed cortical circuit including LPFC, presupplementary motor area/anterior cingulate cortex (pre-SMA/ACC), and the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) ( Prabhakaran et al. 1997 ;  Esposito et al. 1999 ;  Gray et al. 2003 ). Consequently, we aimed to address the following questions: 1) whether COMT  val 158 met  genotype modulates LPFC activity during  g f -related task performance, with COMT  val  allele load being associated with increased LPFC activation, 2) whether COMT  val 158 met  genotype selectively influences LPFC recruitment or modulates activity throughout the extended  g f  cortical network, 3) whether COMT  val 158 met  genotype modulation of  g f -related neural activity is similar across different domains of processing (spatial and verbal), in keeping with COMT v al 158 met  genotype impacting upon a single common mechanism underlying both verbal and spatial forms of  g f , and 4) whether COMT  val 158 met  genotype modulates  g f -related neural activity more robustly than  g f -related task performance. Materials and Methods fMRI Study Participants and Procedure Twenty-two participants (10 males and 12 females, all Caucasian of European descent, all right-handed, age 19–39 years) completed verbal and spatial problem-solving tasks while both behavioral and fMRI data were collected. Details of participant sex and age are given by COMT  val 158 met  genotype in  Supplementary Table S1 . The 3 COMT  val 158 met  genotype groups did not differ significantly on these characteristics ( P  values >0.1). Informed written consent was obtained from all volunteers, and the study was approved by the Cambridgeshire Local Research Ethics committee and performed in compliance with their guidelines. The standard Cambridge exclusion criteria for fMRI studies were followed (no metal and no history of neurological disease or head injury). In addition, all individuals with current or past history of inpatient psychiatric care, those currently on medication for anxiety, depression or sleeping problems, and those on any other form of medication that might influence neurotransmitter function were excluded. All participants completed a standard test of  g f , the Cattell Culture Fair, Scale 2 Form B, in a separate behavioral testing session, conducted in a quiet environment at either the Department of Experimental Psychology, Cambridge University or the Medical Research Council (MRC) Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, Cambridge. Task Design The verbal and spatial problem-solving tasks were taken from  Duncan et al. (2000) . In both tasks, each item consisted of 4 display elements—either drawings (spatial task) or letter sets (verbal task), see  Figure 1 . Participants were instructed to identify the “odd one out”—the element that in some sense differed from the others. In each task, items were split into high  g f  and low  g f  blocks, which lasted for 33 s (3 s for the block type to be specified and 30 s for completion of trials). Figure 1. Example test items for each task. Each item consisted of 4 display elements (drawings or letter sets), and the task was to identify the element that in some sense mismatched or differed from the others. Materials for the high  g f  tasks were adapted with permission from a standard nonverbal test of  g f , Cattell Culture Fair, Scale 2 Form A and Scale 3 ( Institute for Personality and Ability Testing 1973 ) and a standard letter-based problem-solving task, Letter Sets from the ETS kit of factor-referenced tests ( Ekstrom et al. 1976 ). The high  g f  loading of these tasks was previously established ( Wothke et al. 1991 ;  Duncan et al. 2000 ). The low  g f  items were structurally similar but with a minimal problem-solving component. Participants were asked to select the only nonidentical item for the low  g f  spatial task and to select the string not in alphabetic order for the low  g f  verbal task. Items in the high  g f  spatial blocks were adapted with permission from a standard nonverbal test of  g f , Cattell Culture Fair, Scale 2 Form A and Scale 3 ( Institute for Personality and Ability Testing 1973 ). Display elements were 4 panels, each containing one or more shapes, symbols, or drawings. One panel differed in some respect from the others; extensive problem solving was required to identify this panel because the difference could concern any property, often abstract and/or complex. In the example shown in  Figure 1 A , the relevant property is symmetry; the mismatching panel is the 3rd in the row. In the low  g f  spatial blocks, in contrast, there was minimal problem solving. In each display, the 4 panels each contained a single geometrical shape, 3 of which were physically identical, whereas the 4th differed in visually obvious features, such as shape, texture, size or orientation. Materials for the high  g f  verbal blocks were adapted with permission from a standard letter-based problem-solving task, Letter Sets from the Educational Testing Service (ETS) kit of factor-referenced tests ( Ekstrom et al. 1976 ). The high  g f  loading of the original test was established by analysis of a large preexisting data set ( Wothke et al. 1991 ). Display elements were 4 sets of 4 letters each. One set differed in some respect from the others; again, the task required extensive problem solving because a variety of alphabetic and other rules could distinguish the mismatching letter set in any given test item. In the example given in  Figure 1 B , the mismatching set is the 3rd, whose letters are equally spaced in the alphabet. In the low  g f  verbal blocks, the task was simply to find the one set in each display whose letters were not in strict alphabetical order. For both tasks, the position of the mismatching element was indicated by pressing the corresponding key on a 4-choice keyboard, operated with middle and index fingers of the 2 hands. The screen cleared when a response was made, and a new test item was presented immediately. Participants were instructed not to guess but to continue thinking about each problem until they were confident of their answer or until the block terminated. With this constraint, participants were asked to complete as many items as possible during each block. These arrangements ensured that participants worked continuously, despite long solution times for high  g f  items but much shorter times for low  g f  items. The spatial task comprised 4 high  g f  and 4 low  g f  blocks. The verbal task comprised 5 high  g f  and 5 low  g f  blocks. Prior to each task, participants were given full instructions and practice items from both the high  g f  and low  g f  conditions. Stimuli were projected onto a translucent screen positioned behind the head of the participant visible via an angled mirror within the scanner coil. The visual angle subtended by the 4 stimuli presented on each trial was approximately 12°. Image Acquisition BOLD contrast functional images were acquired with echo-planar  T 2 *-weighted (EPI) imaging using a 3-T Bruker Medspec scanner based at the Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK. Image volumes were acquired in 23 interleaved 5-mm-thick axial oblique slices giving whole-brain coverage with an in-plane resolution of 3.75 × 3.75 mm (repetition time  = 1,200 ms; echo time = 30 ms, flip angle = 67.5°). For each participant, data for the spatial task were acquired in a single scanning run of 4 min and data for the verbal task in a single scanning run of 5 min. The first 11 volumes of each run were discarded to allow for  T 1  equilibration effects. Image Analysis SPM software was used ( http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm ). Standard preprocessing was conducted comprising slice-timing correction, realignment, undistortion ( Cusack et al. 2003 ), and skull-stripped normalization of each participant's EPI data to the Montreal Neurological Institute's MNI/ICBM template. Images were resampled into this space with 3-mm isotropic voxels and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 10-mm full-width at half-maximum. Blocks were modeled with step functions of 33-s duration, convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function to form regressors. A high-pass filter of 75 s was used to remove low-frequency noise. A voxelwise random effects analysis was used to analyze data at a group level. Across-participant whole-brain analyses were conducted separately for the spatial and verbal problem-solving tasks. Neural regions showing increased activity during performance of high  g f  versus low  g f  conditions were reported if activity passed a whole-brain false-detection rate (fdr) threshold of  P  < 0.05 ( Genovese et al. 2002 ). Our key analyses examined the effect of COMT  val 158 met  genotype upon high  g f  − low  g f  task-related activity across a network of cortical regions previously implicated in high  g f  task performance ( Prabhakaran et al. 1997 ;  Esposito et al. 1999 ;  Duncan et al. 2000 ;  Gray et al. 2003 ;  Haier and Jung 2007 ). This network includes bilateral dorsal and ventral regions of LPFC, the former corresponding to the dorsal LPFC (DLPFC) region focused upon in genomic imaging studies of WM ( Egan et al. 2001 ;  Bertolino, Blasi, et al. 2006 ), the latter being centered on the frontal operculum/anterior insula (FO/AI). It also encompasses bilateral regions of parietal cortex centered on the IPS and a cortical region extending from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to the presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA). Regions of interest (ROIs) for these regions were derived from a meta-analysis of brain areas coactivated across tasks posing diverse cognitive demands ( Duncan and Owen 2000 ;  Duncan 2006 ). The cortical activation foci from the studies reviewed in those papers were transposed onto 1 hemisphere, smoothed (15-mm Gaussian kernel), and added. The resulting sum map was thresholded to show regions of maximum clustering. This produced peaks in DLPFC ±42, 24, 24; FO/AI ±36, 18, 0; IPS ±36, −54, 39; pre-SMA 0, 21, 45; and ACC 0, 30, 21. It should be noted that the ACC and pre-SMA clusters were not clearly distinct. Our ROIs comprised 10-mm radius spheres centered on these peak coordinates. The ROIs described above were used to examine the influence of COMT  val 158 met  genotype upon  g f -related neural activity. Specifically, a regressor was created to represent the number of COMT  val  alleles possessed (0:  met / met , 1:  val / met , and 2:  val / val ). This effectively divided up the volunteer sample into 3 groups, according to COMT  val  allele load. Two sets of between-group correlational analyses were conducted. First, in line with the analytic approach adopted in previous studies (e.g.,  Smolka et al. 2005 ), neural activity during high  g f  versus low  g f  task performance was regressed against the number of COMT  val  alleles possessed. This analysis was conducted on a voxelwise basis within each ROI, with small volume corrections for multiple comparisons being applied ( Worsley et al. 1996 ). A linear regressor was used, given evidence that  val / met  heterozygotes show COMT activity that is intermediate between that of  met / met  and  val / val  homozygotes. This enabled us to test, for each voxel within our ROIs, whether the magnitude of the BOLD response associated with high  g f  − low  g f  performance varied as a function of the number of  val  alleles possessed. In addition, confirmatory analyses of the influence of COMT  val 158 met  genotype upon neural activation during high  g f  − low  g f  task performance were conducted using the MARSBAR ROI toolbox for SPM99 ( Brett et al. 2002 ). This enables the researcher to extract and average the activation associated with a given contrast across all voxels within an ROI. Using this method, the correlation between the number of COMT  val  alleles possessed by each individual (0–2) and their high  g f  − low  g f  neural activity was calculated for each ROI for both the spatial and verbal tasks. DNA Isolation and Genotyping Analyses All volunteers gave informed consent for a buccal swab to be obtained using a buccal brush. DNA was isolated using the MasterAMP Buccal Swab DNA Extraction Kit (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI). This provides yields of 0.5 to 3 μg of DNA from each buccal sample. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis with horizontal gel electrophoresis was used to determine COMT  val 158 met  genotype (following  Daniels et al. 1996 ;  Egan et al. 2001 ;  Bertolino et al. 2004 ;  Bertolino, Blasi, et al. 2006 ;  Schott et al. 2006 ) Taq polymerase, PCR buffer, and deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates were obtained from Qiagen (www.qiagen.com) and used at recommended concentrations for a 20-ul PCR. A “touchdown” PCR cycling regimen and the addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (10% final v:v) was used in order to optimize the hybridization stringency. Forward: 5′-ACTGTGGCTACTCAGCTGTG-3′ and reverse 5′-CCTTTTTCCAGGTCTGACAA-3′ primers were used. PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 3 min initial heating, then 12 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 30 s and then 28 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. This was followed by restriction digestion with  Nla III. Gel electrophoresis in Metaphor agarose followed by staining in ethidium bromide was used to resolve and visualize DNA fragments. See  Supplementary Materials  for further details. Additional Behavioral Study A total of 146 volunteers (63 males, 83 females; mean age = 25.9 years, all Caucasian of European descent) came into either the Department of Experimental Psychology at Cambridge University or the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, Cambridge, for a 1-h behavioral testing session. Informed written consent was obtained from all volunteers and the study was approved by the Cambridgeshire Local Research Ethics committee and performed in compliance with their guidelines. During the behavioral session, participants completed the Cattell Culture Fair, Scale 2 Form B. It was administered in a quiet environment, according to the manual guidelines. In addition, participants completed a number of questionnaires and a medical screening form (for past neurological injury, medication, and psychiatric history) and provided a buccal swab for DNA analysis (as described under DNA Isolation and Genotyping Analyses above). Participant sex and age are given by COMT  val 158 met  genotype in  Supplementary Table S1 . The 3 COMT genotype groups did not differ significantly on these characteristics ( P  values >0.1). Results Across Participants: High g f  Conditions Activate LPFC, IPS, and Pre-SMA/ACC Across participants, whole-brain analyses conducted separately on data from the spatial and verbal tasks revealed significant increases in activity in LPFC, pre-SMA/ACC, and IPS during high  g f  versus low  g f  conditions. These results held for both tasks (see  Fig. 2 ). The high  g f  versus low  g f  subtraction gave extensive bilateral activations in the spatial task and predominantly left lateralized activation in the verbal task, in line with our prior results ( Duncan et al. 2000 ). This subtraction also produced activation in the cerebellum for the spatial task and in the precuneus and orbitofrontal cortex for the verbal task, but no regions outside of the predicted network showed enhanced activity across both high  g f  conditions. Figure 2. Neural activation associated with high  g f  versus low  g f  task performance.

COMT val 158 met Genotype Modulates Activity across the Whole Frontoparietal High g f  Network during Performance of High g f  versus Low g f  Tasks As predicted, between-group regression analyses showed a significant positive correlation between COMT  val  allele load (number of  val  alleles possessed, 0–2) and high  g f  − low  g f  neural activity in LPFC. Parallel effects were observed in other regions across the extended high  g f  network including pre-SMA, ACC, and IPS (see  Fig. 3  and  Table 1 ). The results obtained with the independent measures of  g f -related brain activity from the spatial and verbal tasks were strikingly similar, with right DLPFC, right and left IPS, and pre-SMA showing a significant correlation between  val  allele load and high  g f  − low  g f  neural activity in both tasks.

In these analyses, activation was averaged across all the voxels in each ROI, the resulting composite value for each ROI being regressed, across volunteers, against the number of COMT  val  alleles possessed (0–2). These analyses also revealed a significant positive relationship between  val  allele load and high  g f  − low  g f  neural activity in right DLPFC, right and left IPS, and pre-SMA across both tasks, with a similar but weaker pattern in ACC (see  Table 2 ).

Behavioral Results and Behavior/Brain Regression Analyses We were interested in whether the relationship between COMT  val 158 met  genotype and activity across the high  g f  network would be linked to differences in  g f -related task performance. As noted in the introduction, proponents of the intermediate phenotype approach have suggested that gene–behavior effects may be less robust and harder to reliably detect than genetic influences upon neural activity. Given this and in the light of null results from previous studies investigating influences of specific genetic markers upon intelligence test scores ( Plomin et al. 2001 ), we did not have strong predictions as to whether we would observe COMT  val 158 met  genotype effects upon performance of our  g f  measures. Our behavioral results were as follows. In the scanner, a positive correlation was observed between COMT  val  allele load and performance (number of correct responses) for the spatial high  g f  task;  r  = 0.47,  P  < 0.03 2 tailed, with a nonsignificant trend in the same direction for the verbal high  g f  task;  r  = 0.31,  P  = 0.15 2 tailed. We conducted additional regression analyses in order to examine the relationship between performance in the spatial and verbal high  g f  tasks and task-related neural activity across the entire group of volunteers. These revealed a positive relationship between performance and recruitment of right DLPFC during high versus low  g f  conditions of the spatial task,  x ,  y ,  z  = 42, 24, 27,  Z  = 3.10,  P  = 0.02 small volume corrected (svc), whereas for the verbal task, there was a trend towards a similar result for left FO/AI,  x ,  y ,  z  = −36, 27, −3,  Z  = 2.68,  P  = 0.06 svc. There was no significant relationship between high  g f  task performance and activity in any of the other ROIs ( P  values >0.1). Notably, with high  g f  task performance entered as a covariate, all the reported associations between COMT  val 158 met  genotype and regional fMRI activity remained significant (see  Table 1 ). However, entering high  g f  versus low  g f  right DLPFC activity as a covariate for the spatial task and high  g f  versus low  g f  left FO/AI activity for the verbal task removed any relationship between COMT  val 158 met  genotype and high  g f  task performance;  r (19) = 0.19,  P  > 0.4;  r (19) = 0.11,  P  > 0.5, respectively. Effect of COMT val 158 met Genotype on High g f  Task Performance Outside the Scanner As mentioned above, previous studies have found no significant effect of COMT  val 158 met  genotype on behavioral performance of other standardized tests of intelligence such as the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children—Revised ( Plomin et al. 2001 ). While these measures arguably have greater  g c  loadings than the measures used in the current study, we were interested in whether the behavioral effect we observed for the spatial  g f  task performed within the scanner would be replicated with a parallel measure administered outside of the scanner environment. All participants in the fMRI study were additionally asked to complete scale 2B of Cattell Culture Fair ( Institute for Personality and Ability Testing 1973 ) as part of a separate behavioral testing session. In contrast to the results obtained with the spatial high  g f  task in the scanner, no significant association was observed between COMT  val  allele load and scale 2B performance outside of the scanner environment,  r (22) = 0.10,  P  > 0.1. We confirmed this result with a larger sample of 146 volunteers who also completed scale 2B of Cattell Culture Fair outside the fMRI environment (see Materials and Methods and  Supplementary Table S1 ). Here again, we found no significant association between COMT  val  allele load and scale 2B scores,  r (145) = −0.11,  P  > 0.1. Discussion Across participants, whole-brain analyses conducted separately on data from the spatial and verbal  g f  tasks revealed significant increases in activity in LPFC, pre-SMA/ACC, and IPS during high  g f  versus low  g f  conditions. No other neural regions showed enhanced activity across both high  g f  conditions. This supports the contention that a fairly constrained network of regions including LPFC, pre-SMA/ACC, and IPS comprises the neural substrate that supports  g f . This falls in line with findings by  Prabhakaran et al. (1997) ,  Esposito et al. (1999) , and  Gray et al. (2003)  and extends the results from our earlier PET study ( Duncan et al. 2000 ), which primarily indicated a role for LPFC. Regression analyses showed a significant positive correlation between COMT  val  allele load and high  g f  − low  g f  neural activity in LPFC, pre-SMA/ACC, and IPS. This held for both verbal and spatial measures of  g f . It is of note that COMT  val 158 met  genotype modulated activity associated with high  g f  versus low  g f  task performance across the whole frontoparietal extended high  g f  network and not just in LPFC. There are a number of potential explanations for this finding. First, the COMT  val 158 met  polymorphism may have a direct impact on DA metabolism in all the regions concerned. LPFC, ACC, and IPS all receive dopaminergic projections ( Bentivoglio and Morelli 2005 ). Furthermore, in addition to the established influence of the COMT  val 158 met  polymorphism upon LPFC function ( Winterer and Goldman 2003 ), recent studies have also reported COMT  val 158 met  genotype modulation of ACC and IPS function ( Blasi et al. 2005 ;  Bertolino, Blasi, et al. 2006 ;  Williams-Gray et al. 2007 ). Second, it is possible that the COMT  val 158 met  polymorphism affects activity in one or more regions of the high  g f  network through its influence upon metabolism of norepinephrine ( Mannisto and Kaakkola 1999 , though see  Tunbridge et al. 2006 ); the ascending catecholamine neuromodulatory systems operating both separately and conjointly to influence cortical function ( Robbins and Everitt 1995 ). Finally, an alternative account would be that modulation of LPFC function by COMT  val 158 met  genotype in turn up- or downregulates activation in other key regions, accounting for the association between COMT  val 158 met  genotype and activation in these additional areas. Another question of interest concerns the relationship of the current findings to previous reports of COMT  val 158 met  genotype modulation of prefrontal activity during tasks tapping executive function, in particular, WM as assessed by the “ n -back” task ( Egan et al. 2001 ;  Bertolino, Blasi, et al. 2006 ). Here, work on the relationship between  g f  and WM is particularly pertinent ( Ackerman et al. 2005 ;  Kane et al. 2005 ). The observation of relatively low zero-order correlations between performance on WM tasks and tests of  g f  ( Engle et al. 1999 ;  Ackerman et al. 2005 ) has led to a relative consensus that WM capacity is not isomorphic with  g  or  g f  ( Kane et al. 2005 ;  Birney et al. 2006 ;  Heitz et al. 2006 ). Latent variable analyses of short-term memory tasks (which primarily involve temporary storage of information) and WM tasks (which involve online manipulation as well as temporary storage of information, e.g., the  n -back task) have suggested that it is the WM residual (the component not shared with short-term memory tasks) which loads strongly onto  g f  ( Engle et al. 1999 , though see  Colom et al. 2006 ). This has been taken as evidence that the component of WM variance explained by  g f  is related to the executive or attentional aspects of WM ( Engle et al. 1999 ;  Gray et al. 2003 ). Given this, an interesting prediction for future work is that no significant effect of COMT  val 158 met  genotype on  n -back–related LPFC activity will be observed after controlling for this attentional or executive component. More generally, continued application of the latent variable approach to tests of  g f , attentional control, WM, and other cognitive processes, combined with analysis of genomic imaging data from multiple tests of higher order cognition, should enable us to achieve a clearer picture of the component processes central to  g f  and their individual or collective modulation by both the COMT  val 158 met  SNP and other functional genetic polymorphisms. We turn now to consideration of COMT  val 158 met  genotype effects upon  g f -related task performance. Within the scanner, a positive correlation was observed between COMT  val  allele load and performance on the spatial high  g f  task, with a trend in the same direction for the verbal high  g f  task. Regression analyses revealed that entering high  g f  versus low  g f  LPFC activity as a covariate eliminated the relationship between COMT  val 158 met  genotype and high  g f  task performance. In contrast, with high  g f  task performance entered as a covariate, all the reported associations between COMT  val 158 met  genotype and regional fMRI activity remained significant. These findings provide some support for the claim put forward by proponents of the “candidate gene intermediate phenotype” approach that a more direct and robust relationship exists between genetic markers and neural activity than between genetic markers and behavioral performance ( Hariri and Weinberger 2003 ;  Goldberg and Weinberger 2004 ). This suggests that attempts to advance understanding of genetic and environmental influences upon  g f  beyond assessment of heritability may be facilitated not only by the consideration of specific genetic markers but also by complementing behavioral indices of performance with consideration of intermediate neural mechanisms. The positive correlation observed between COMT  val  allele load and the spatial measure of  g f  derived from the Cattell Culture Fair for use within the scanner is consistent with the prediction of a  val  advantage on tasks requiring flexible cognition ( Bilder et al. 2004 ). However, it is of note that, outside the scanner, we observed no significant relationship between COMT  val 158 met  genotype and Cattell Culture Fair Scale 2B scores. This is in line with previous studies which have failed to find a replicable effect of single genetic polymorphisms, including the COMT  val 158 met  polymorphism, upon behavioral performance of standardized intelligence tests (e.g.,  Plomin et al. 2001 ) though, as mentioned earlier, those studies used less pure indices of  g f . The difference in our behavioral findings inside and outside the scanner might simply reflect the low power of gene-behavior analyses, leading to difficulties in the replication of behavioral results with relatively small sample sizes. Indeed, it has been suggested that sample sizes in the 100s to 1,000s may be needed to reliably detect effects of single genes upon cognitive performance measures, whereas far smaller samples may suffice for detecting effects of the same genes upon neural activation indices ( Hariri and Weinberger 2003 ). An alternative, potentially more interesting possibility is that the scanner environment itself may have a moderating influence. Like ours, other studies have reported differing behavioral effects of the COMT  val 158 met  polymorphism inside and outside the fMRI environment ( Egan et al. 2001 ;  Goldberg et al. 2003 ). It has also been speculated that state or environmental factors impacting on arousal levels may modulate the effect of COMT  val 158 met  genotype upon prefrontal function ( Tunbridge et al. 2006 ). Scanner noise could be one such factor. It has been demonstrated that noise can act similarly to DA D1 agonists in moving subjects along the inverted U–shaped response function that characterizes the relationship between DA D1 receptor stimulation and prefrontal function ( Arnsten and Goldman-Rakic 1998 ). It is conceivable that scanner noise could alter positioning on the D1-PFC response function such that increased DA metabolism associated with the COMT  val  allele optimizes high  g f  task performance. Other factors associated with task performance within the scanner—for example partial immobilization leading to mild claustrophobia or “restraint stress” in some individuals—could also contribute to a potential interaction of COMT genotype by context (task performed inside vs. outside the scanner). The possibility that cognitive function in general and indices of  g f  in particular may be influenced by aspects of the current environment that alter arousal levels or affective state is receiving renewed attention ( Gray et al. 2002 ;  Blair 2006 ). Together with increasing awareness of the potential impact of immediate environmental context and longer term environmental factors upon gene–brain and gene–behavior associations ( Caspi et al. 2003 ;  Canli et al. 2006 ;  Tunbridge et al. 2006 ), this highlights the need for future work directly addressing these issues. In summary, our findings indicate that the COMT  val 158 met  polymorphism has a significant influence upon neural activity across a network of cortical regions, including LPFC, pre-SMA/ACC, and IPS, during performance of high  g f  versus low  g f  tasks. We obtained 2 measures of  g f -related neural activation using tasks from very different domains (1 spatial and 1 verbal). In both cases, the number of the more metabolically active COMT  val  alleles possessed significantly predicted the strength of the neural response in right DLPFC, pre-SMA, and bilateral IPS during performance of high  g f  versus low  g f  items. The strong influence of the COMT  val 158 met  polymorphism upon the extended cortical circuitry underlying  g f -related task performance is in line with the suggestion that the effects of single genes may be observed relatively clearly at the neurophysiological level of analysis achieved by fMRI. It also suggests that genetic influences upon catecholamine modulation of this circuitry might account for a significant proportion of individual variability in the neural response to increases in higher cognitive demands across differing domains of processing. These genetic influences are inevitably complex and likely to extend beyond the  val 158 met  SNP studied here. Additional studies of other common genetic variants impacting upon catecholamine function, together with larger scale haplotype studies and analysis of imaging data acquired using multiple measures of higher cognitive function, should aid in further clarifying genetic contributions to catecholamine modulation of higher cognitive function.
