 The discovery of cortical networks that participate in pain processing has led to the common generalization that blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses in these areas indicate the processing of pain. Physical stimuli have fundamental properties that elicit sensations distinguishable from pain, such as heat. We hypothesized that pain intensity coding may reflect the intensity coding of heat sensation during the presentation of thermal stimuli during fMRI. Six 3T fMRI heat scans were collected for 16 healthy subjects, corresponding to perceptual levels of “low innocuous heat”, “moderate innocuous heat”, “high innocuous heat”, “low painful heat”, “moderate painful heat”, and “high painful heat” delivered by a contact thermode to the face. Subjects rated pain and heat intensity separately after each scan. A general linear model analysis detected different patterns of brain activation for the different phases of the biphasic response to heat. During “high painful heat”, the early phase was associated with significant anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex activation. Persistent responses were detected in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal lobule. Only the late phase showed significant correlations with perceptual ratings. Significant heat intensity correlated activation was identified in contralateral primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, motor cortex, and superior temporal lobe. These areas were significantly more related to heat ratings than pain. These results indicate that heat intensity is encoded by the somatosensory cortices, and that pain evaluation may either arise from multimodal evaluative processes, or is a distributed process.

 Introduction 
 The sensation of pain rarely exists independently of other sensations, particularly when induced by contact heat. Heat and pain sensation are clearly separable percepts, as “how hot something feels” is distinctly different from “how much something hurts.” Neuroimaging over the past decade suggests that pain intensity coding occurs over a network of cortical areas that includes the primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, anterior and posterior insula, and the anterior cingulate cortex ( Derbyshire et al., 1997 ;  Bushnell et al., 1999 ;  Coghill et al., 1999 ;  Bornhovd et al., 2002 ;  Buchel et al., 2002 ;  Porro et al., 2003 ;  Ringler et al., 2003 ;  Moulton et al., 2005 ;  Johnstone et al., 2011 ). Such studies have used finely calibrated noxious stimuli, often in the form of heat, to evoke increasing levels of pain accompanied by increasing levels of brain activity. However, graded neural responses to a range of noxious temperatures may simply reflect intensity coding of a restricted range of heat sensation rather than pain per se. 
 To our knowledge, the possibility that the encoding of heat intensity may be misidentified as pain intensity has not been addressed in pain imaging. While highly correlated at higher temperatures, the percepts of heat and pain are clearly dissociable in the non-noxious range. Neuroimaging studies of innocuous heat intensity coding indicate at least some degree of overlap with areas related to pain intensity, such as the insula ( Craig et al., 2000 ;  Olausson et al., 2005 ). This possibility suggests that the inclusion of more than one innocuous stimulus intensity level could better assess the specificity of heat vs. pain intensity coding in the brain. 
 Though noxious and innocuous heat responses are differentiable by their temporal profile, pain intensity coding has rarely been considered in the context of the shape of the hemodynamic response. Previous studies reported that in many cases, the BOLD response to painful contact heat is biphasic, whereas the response to innocuous heat is monophasic ( Becerra et al., 2001 ;  Chen et al., 2002 ;  Wager et al., 2004 ;  Moulton et al., 2005 ;  Upadhyay et al., 2010 ). The biphasic response pattern for noxious contact heat has been proposed to represent different circuit involvement for salience/threat detection (early phase) and the appraisal of pain intensity (late phase) ( Becerra et al., 2001 ). The late phase of the biphasic response in primary somatosensory cortex has been reported to be capable of differentiating noxious heat stimuli separated by 1°C ( Moulton et al., 2005 ). Considering the separate phases of the BOLD response to contact heat stimuli may also help differentiate pain vs. heat intensity coding in the brain. 
 We hypothesized that BOLD signals in brain areas responsive to heat are more reflective of perceived heat intensity than pain intensity. To test this assertion, we used 3T fMRI to record BOLD responses to a range of innocuous and noxious temperatures in healthy volunteers. Perceptual ratings of heat intensity and pain intensity were collected for every temperature level to directly compare the relationship of these different sensory percepts with this measure of brain activity. 
 
 
 Methods 
 
 
 
 Subjects 
 Sixteen healthy right-handed subjects (8 males, 8 females; 28.8±7.7 years old) were recruited by advertisement and provided written informed consent to participate in this experiment. All females reported contraceptive use, including oral contraception (n=6), contraceptive intramuscular injection (n=1), and a contraceptive vaginal ring (n=1). Recent drug use was ruled out by negative results on a urine screen (Alfa Scientific Designs, Inc., Poway, CA). The study was approved by the McLean Hospital Institutional Review Board, and met the scientific and ethical guidelines for human pain research of the Helsinki Accord ( http://ohsr.od.nih.gov/guidelines/helsinki.html ) and the International Association for the Study of Pain. 
 
 
 Thermal stimulation 
 A 1.6×1.6cm contact thermode (TSA-II, Medoc Advanced Medical Systems, Ramat Yishai, Israel) was used to deliver thermal stimuli to the right cheek, in the area innervated by the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve. More precisely, the thermode was fixed on the maxilla, just inferior and medial to the prominence of the zygomatic bone. The face was selected because of its high sensitivity to heat ( Rolke et al., 2006 ). Six different target temperatures were used during fMRI scanning, and were customized to each subject’s perception as determined through pre-scan testing. The six selected stimulus levels represented a range of perceptual intensities, which included three innocuous and three painful temperatures based on subject reports (see  Pre-scan testing  below for details). At rest, the thermode maintained a steady baseline temperature of 35°C. The target temperature was maintained for 24 seconds, the rate of temperature change was 5°C/sec, and the inter-stimulus interval was 30 seconds. 
 
 
 Perceptual ratings 
 Subjects used computerized visual analog scales (VAS) to separately rate heat intensity and pain intensity using a hand-held analog dial in their left hand. The scales were presented horizontally, presented sequentially one after the other, and were titled “Heat” and “Pain”. The markers for the extremes of the heat intensity scale were labeled “No heat” to “Most intense”, and “No pain” and “Most intense” for the pain intensity scale. The software package LabVIEW 5.1 (National Instruments Corp., Austin, TX) was used to display the scales. VAS ratings were recorded digitally as numerical values from 0–10, though the scales did not display numbers to the subjects. For fMRI scans, ratings were collected after each scan. 
 
 
 Pre-scan testing 
 Subjects underwent quantitative sensory testing to determine the six temperatures that they were to receive during the fMRI scanning. An ascending staircase procedure was conducted, consisting of a resting baseline of 35°C and target temperatures that sequentially increased by 1°C each step. Each temperature was delivered discretely, as described above in  Thermal stimulation . Subjects rated heat and pain intensity after the completion of each stimulus. The six stimulus levels to be used in the scanner were selected in the following manner: T1) low innocuous heat – first non-zero rating of heat intensity (heat detection threshold); T2) moderate innocuous heat – the midpoint between the low and high heat temperatures; T3) high innocuous heat – the highest non-painful temperature (pain detection threshold −1°C); T4) low painful heat– first non-zero rating of pain intensity (pain detection threshold); T5) moderate painful heat – pain intensity VAS rating of “4–6”; and T6) high painful heat – pain intensity VAS rating of “7–10”. 
 
 
 Scanning Experimental Paradigm 
 Each subject underwent a single scanning session, which included six randomized fMRI scans consisting of thermal stimulation presented in an event-related design. Each functional scan used a single target temperature that corresponded to one of the six different stimulus levels determined for each subject during pre-scan testing. fMRI scans consisted of a 42-s baseline period followed by three stimulus cycles, as described above. The high painful heat scan was always performed last, but the scan order for the other stimulus levels was randomized. After the completion of each fMRI scan, subjects retrospectively rated the average peak heat intensity and pain intensity experienced. 
 
 
 Image Acquisition 
 Subjects were scanned in a 3T Siemens Trio MRI scanner using a circularly polarized head coil. Anatomical images were acquired using a magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence (128 1.33mm-thick slices with an in-plane resolution of 1 mm [256×256]). Functional scans were collected using an echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence (TE/TR = 30/2500ms). Functional scans consisted of 41 slices, with 3.5mm isometric resolution, with the acquisition coronally oriented to the match the brainstem axis and included the cerebellum. Eighty-eight volumes were captured in each fMRI scan (3:40). 
 
 
 Individual Subject Level Image Pre-processing 
 Functional image data sets were processed and analyzed with FSL 4.1.5 (FMRIB’s Software Library,  www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl ) ( Smith et al., 2004 ). Visual screening of the functional volumes revealed that none of the subjects showed indications of gross movement (> 1 voxel). The initial two volumes were removed from each of the functional scans to allow for signal equilibration. The skull and other non-brain areas were extracted from the anatomical and functional scans using FSL’s script brain extraction tool (BET). Motion Correction using FMRIB’s Linear Image Registration Tool (MCFLIRT) was performed on each functional scan. All volumes were mean-based intensity normalized by the same factor. The volumes were spatially smoothed with a 5 mm full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) filter, and a 100 second high-pass temporal filter was applied. 
 
 
 Scout analysis to define appropriate hemodynamic response function 
 Previous imaging studies using contact thermodes suggest that the hemodynamic response for painful heat is biphasic, and is inadequately modeled using a conventional monophasic gamma-convolved explanatory variable (for review, see ( Upadhyay et al., 2010 )). The “high painful heat” scans from four randomly selected subjects served as a scout dataset to define the most appropriate hemodynamic response function for our experimental paradigm. 
 First-level fMRI analysis of single subject data was performed with FMRI Expert Analysis Tool using FMRIB’s Improved Linear Model (FEAT FILM) Version 5.98 with local autocorrelation correction ( Woolrich et al., 2001 ). For the scout dataset, the temperature profiles recorded during the high painful heat scan were rescaled from 0 to 1 and entered as explanatory variables (EVs), as were their temporal derivatives to account for small temporal delays. Temperature EVs were convolved with a gamma function incorporating a 3-s standard deviation and a 6-s hemodynamic lag. Two additional covariates of no interest were included that modeled the mean signal time courses measured in white matter and cerebrospinal fluid, as segmented by FMRIB’s Automated Segmentation Tool (FAST). The resulting individual subject-level statistical maps from all FEAT analyses were co-registered with the subjects’ anatomical images with FMRIB’s Linear Image Registration Tool (FLIRT). 
 Group activation maps were generated by fMRI Expert Analysis Tool (FEAT) fMRIB’s Local Analysis of Mixed Effects (FLAME). For the high painful heat scan, a fixed effects analysis was performed on the scout dataset ( Figure 1 ) to identify stimulus-related activation in contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (S1), as this region of interest (ROI) has previously shown biphasic responses to painful heat. Trial averaging in the scout subjects revealed two distinct positive responses in contralateral S1 (for methodological detail, refer to ( Moulton et al., 2007 )). 
 An iterative procedure was performed to identify the most appropriate model to fit the observed left S1 trial average response. The single trial EV was divided into four parts (e1, e2, e3, e4) using 3 split points based on model fitting of the trial average ( Figure 1 ). For each choice of the 3 split points, the four parts e1, e2, e3, and e4 were: demeaned, gamma convolved, demeaned, high pass filtered (100 s), and demeaned. The convolved and high pass filtered e1, e2, e3, and e4 were entered into a general linear model (GLM) analysis to model the demeaned trial average response for left S1. A demeaned linear drift was added to the GLM as a confound of no interest to account for end effects in high pass filtering. The mean squared error (MSE) of the GLM was saved as a model fit measure. We repeated this analysis for every possible combination of the 3 split points. Finally, we selected the split points that provided the smallest MSE over all combinations. The optimal split points were such that e1 corresponded to time point 6, e2 to time point 7, e3 consisted of time points 8 to 11, and e4 consisted of time points 12 to 17. Note that a single time point separated e1 and e2. Hence, we replaced the set [e1, e2] by the set [e2, de2], where de2 is the temporal derivative of e2. The logic for doing this was to use e2 to capture the “early” response and de2 to capture small variations in “onset” of the early response across subjects. We validated the selection of these split points by repeating the same analysis we performed for left S1 for two other functional ROIs (bilateral S1 and bilateral insula), which confirmed that the selected split points were near optimal for these additional ROIs as well. Thus, a 3 EV model was established that consisted of EV1 (e2, de2), EV2 (e3), and EV3 (e4). 
 
 
 Image Analysis with 3 EV model 
 Image analysis for the experimental dataset of 12 subjects, not including the scout subjects, proceeded similarly as described above, but using the three EV model at the single subject level. FLAME was run to perform two separate types of mixed effect group analyses, to detect: 1) high painful heat activation relating to each of the three EVs, and 2) BOLD correlation with Heat and Pain intensity ratings as parametric modulators entered into the same model, and a contrast of these correlational factors for each of the three EVs separately. For the correlation analysis, within-subject variation of heat and pain intensity ratings was taken into account. All activations, correlations, and contrasts had a significance threshold criterion of Z > 2.3 with a cluster significance threshold of p < 0.05 (corrected for multiple comparisons). 
 
 
 
 Statistical analysis of psychophysical measures 
 To test the differentiability of heat intensity and pain intensity reports, a two-way repeated measures ANOVA was performed with the factors “VAS modality”, consisting of two levels (Heat/Pain), and “stimulus level”, consisting of six levels (T1/T2/T3/T4/T5/T6). This was treated as a repeated measures analysis, as all subjects rated Heat and Pain for each stimulus level, and all subjects received each of the six stimulus levels. 
 
 
 
 Results 
 
 Psychophysics 
 In the experimental dataset (n=12), the temperatures that corresponded with the six stimulus levels were 36.8±0.8°C (T1), 38.8±1.8°C (T2), 40.8±3.1°C (T3), 41.8±3.1°C (T4), 45.6±2.2°C (T5), and 47.8±2.2°C (T6) ( Figure 2 ). Temperatures showed a significant increase with increasing stimulus level (Repeated measures ANOVA [stimulus level], F(5)=112.93, p<0.0001). 
 The 12 subjects were able to differentiate between heat intensity and pain intensity across the range of stimulus levels tested in the scanner ( Figure 2 , two way repeated measures ANOVA [VAS modality, stimulus level], VAS modality F(1)=6.367, p<0.05). A significant effect of stimulus level on perceptual ratings was also observed ( Figure 2 , two way repeated measures ANOVA [VAS modality, stimulus level], stimulus level F(5)=109.132, p<0.0001). For perceptual ratings, no significant interaction between VAS modality and stimulus level was detected (two way repeated measures ANOVA [VAS modality, stimulus level], interaction F(5)=0.584, p=0.71). 
 
 
 “High painful heat” group-level activation 
 Different patterns of regional brain activation were detected for each of the three EVs corresponding to “early phase”, “interval phase”, and “late phase” responses ( Figure 3 ;  Table 1 ). The early phase EV detected significant activation in midline anterior cingulate cortex, bilaterally in anterior insula, and ipsilaterally in supramarginal gyrus, angular gyrus, superior parietal lobule, and middle frontal gyrus. The interval phase EV also detected activation ipsilaterally in anterior insula, supramarginal gyrus, angular gyrus, superior parietal lobule, and middle frontal gyrus, but additional activation was found ipsilaterally in thalamus, inferior frontal gyrus, and primary motor cortex. Activations in the anterior cingulate cortex and contralateral anterior insula, found in the early phase, were not detected during the interval phase. Similar to the early and interval phases, the late phase EV detected activation ipsilaterally in supramarginal gyrus, angular gyrus, superior parietal gyrus, and middle frontal gyrus. The late phase EV also revealed novel prominent activation in ipsilateral secondary somatosensory cortex (S2). Both early and late phase EVs detected activation in contralateral primary somatosensory cortex for Z > 2.3, but only when not applying the cluster significance threshold. 
 
 
 Brain activations correlated with perceptual intensity 
 Only late phase EV related brain activity showed significant correlations with perceptual ratings for heat and pain ( Figure 4 ;  Table 2 ). Heat VAS ratings were significantly correlated with contralateral S1, S2, primary motor cortex, and superior/middle temporal gyrus. Pain VAS ratings were significantly correlated with bilateral thalamus, in the vicinity of the ventroposteriomedial thalamus. A contrast of Heat VAS- and Pain VAS-correlated activity revealed a significantly greater slope for the BOLD-VAS correlation for Heat ratings in contralateral primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, primary motor cortex, and superior/middle temporal gyrus. The same contrast revealed no areas with significantly increased slope for the BOLD-VAS relationship for Pain ratings. An identical control analysis for these contrasts that only included scans with pain reports above zero (n=56 out of 72 scans) revealed the same outcome as observed in the full analysis (data not shown). Thus, the main result does not reflect a difference in the numbers of non-zero values rather than a true physiological difference. 
 
 
 
 Discussion 
 Across a range of innocuous and noxious temperatures, BOLD signals in S1 and S2 contralateral to stimulation were statistically better correlated with perceptual ratings of heat intensity than pain intensity. Our results suggest that fMRI measures of neural activity in somatosensory cortices better reflect magnitude of heat sensation, rather than pain intensity specifically. These correlational differences, as well as the correlations themselves, were specific only to late phase responses. Also, early, interval, and late phase analyses revealed different subsets of brain activation related to noxious heat. These findings suggest a temporal differentiation of brain responses to heat, which may indicate activation of different functional networks. 
 
 Heat intensity encoding 
 That heat sensation is more closely related to activity in primary somatosensory cortex than pain sensation is alluded to by animal research. Electrophysiological recordings in primate S1 indicate that neurons that respond to a range of heat (wide dynamic range) fire more vigorously than those that respond specifically to noxious heat (nociceptive-specific) ( Kenshalo et al., 2000 ). Anesthesia, usually in combination with an agent inducing muscle paralysis, does not eliminate S1 responses to acute noxious heat measured electrophysiologically in primates ( Kenshalo and Isensee, 1983 ;  Chudler et al., 1990 ;  Kenshalo et al., 2000 ). Though diminished, persistent responses to noxious thermal stimuli suggest that neural activity in S1 does not rely on conscious perception and may better reflect the neural representation of heat intensity rather than pain. In turn, perhaps separate percepts of heat and pain arise from the evaluation of how S1 encodes heat intensity. Notably, neuroimaging studies in rodents suggest that other painful stimuli aside from heat also show persistent responses in somatosensory cortex and other regions, even under anesthesia (for review, see ( Borsook and Becerra, 2011 )). 
 Though animal literature indicates that S2 neurons responsive to noxious thermal stimuli are rare ( Robinson and Burton, 1980 ;  Dong et al., 1994 ), S2 has been specifically implicated in heat intensity coding in electrophysiological recordings in humans. Electroencephalography in healthy subjects has related intensity coding of noxious laser stimuli to evoked potential amplitude in operculoinsular region, as well as S1 ( Iannetti et al., 2005 ). Intracortical recordings of laser-evoked potentials in patients indicated that S2 is capable of encoding fine discrimination of both innocuous and painful heat intensity ( Frot et al., 2007 ). The correlation we observed between heat intensity ratings and BOLD responses in S2 suggests that fMRI is also capable of detecting heat intensity dependent S2 responses previously measured with intracortical electrodes. 
 
 
 Pain intensity coding? 
 Our analysis did not detect any brain responses with a statistically greater correlation with pain intensity ratings than heat intensity ratings. As heat intensity perception was well correlated with activity in somatosensory cortices, this suggests that pain may arise secondarily to the primary sensation of heat through a cognitive/evaluative process. In other words, S1 and S2 encoded the intensity of the heat stimulus, heat perception closely mirrored this cortical representation of heat intensity, and multimodal evaluative brain regions interpreted this heat representation in terms of its level of painfulness. 
 Candidate areas for this cognitive evaluative process may include right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, supramarginal gyrus, and angular gyrus, which were the only brain regions persistently active throughout T6. A similar evaluative role for right prefrontal cortex has been suggested previously for heat pain ( Coghill et al., 1999 ;  Kong et al., 2006 ), and other evidence suggests that a multisensory magnitude estimation process may occur in lateral prefrontal cortex and adjoining insula ( Baliki et al., 2009 ). Though right supramarginal gyrus and angular gyrus have not been explicitly linked to evaluative processes, these parietal areas have been implicated with multisensory spatial processing ( Calvert, 2001 ;  Renier et al., 2009 ) and, when damaged, sensory neglect ( Mesulam, 1981 ;  Mort et al., 2003 ). Activation of these multisensory processing regions during heat stimuli likely reflects attentional processes that are automatically engaged ( Derbyshire et al., 1997 ;  Coghill et al., 2001 ), which may play a further role in cognitive evaluation of such stimuli. An alternative explanation is that evaluation of stimuli represented in somatosensory cortices as painful is a distributed process, and occurs over a network of areas activated with noxious stimuli ( Coghill et al., 1994 ;  Apkarian et al., 2005 ;  Kong et al., 2006 ;  Seminowicz and Davis, 2006 ;  Helmchen et al., 2008 ). 
 
 
 Temporal differentiation of activation “networks” 
 By differentiating three distinct phases of the hemodynamic response, we were able to detect changes in brain activation patterns over the course of stimulus application. Previous time course investigations of BOLD responses to noxious contact heat have reported a stereotypical biphasic response ( Becerra et al., 2001 ;  Wager et al., 2004 ;  Upadhyay et al., 2010 ), which appear to share the same temporal profile as we recorded in our scout dataset. Previously, the biphasic response was defined by dividing the response into two halves, whereas we found that curve fitting of the response in contralateral S1 modeled early and late phases separated by an intermediate interval phase. Different patterns of brain activity associated with these three phases, in addition to previous reports of biphasic responses, suggest a temporal differentiation of functional networks activated during noxious contact heat. This “biphasic” hemodynamic response with distinct early, interval, and late phases may be particular for noxious contact heat, as responses to brief noxious laser stimuli are monophasic ( Bornhovd et al., 2002 ;  Buchel et al., 2002 ). Long duration contact heat would result in more sustained drive of primary afferents, as well as dynamic changes in attention, endogenous pain modulation, and cognitive valuation, all of which could potentially contribute to the biphasic response we observed. Thus, our results may apply specifically to contact heat stimulation as used in this study. 
 Early phase featured prominent activation of anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral anterior insula. These areas are consistently tied to pain processing, though specificity of these responses to pain is somewhat controversial ( Legrain et al., 2011 ). A recent fMRI study found that cingulate and insular responses to painful laser stimuli could reflect a multimodal salience-detection process ( Mouraux et al., 2011 ). Activation during early phase has also been suggested to reflect an early threat-detection process and autonomic affective valuation of aversive stimuli ( Becerra et al., 2001 ;  Maihofner et al., 2011 ), and our finding that cingulate and insula activate during early phase is also consistent with their involvement in transient attention orienting processes ( Davis et al., 1997 ;  Peyron et al., 1999 ;  Wiech et al., 2010 ;  Mouraux et al., 2011 ). Perhaps monophasic responses to extremely brief laser stimuli ( Bornhovd et al., 2002 ;  Buchel et al., 2002 ) and innocuous contact heat ( Moulton et al., 2005 ) reflect an isolated triggering of this early phase that relates to stimulus detection. 
 Late phase featured activation of ipsilateral S2, as well as heat intensity-correlated brain activity in contralateral S1 and S2. This late phase was the only part of the BOLD response to heat that had significant correlations with perceptual ratings. These data are consistent with previous findings that late phase corresponded with: 1) fine discrimination of noxious heat intensity in contralateral S1 ( Moulton et al., 2005 ); 2) the conscious central nervous system response to pain ( Becerra et al., 2001 ); 3) the gradual ascent of online pain intensity ratings which correlated with BOLD responses to noxious heat in contralateral S1 and S2 ( Chen et al., 2002 ); 4) optical imaging in squirrel monkeys which revealed temporal summation of long latency noxious responses in S1 that correlated with human reports of pain intensity to similar heat stimuli ( Tommerdahl et al., 1996 ); and 5) decreases with reduced pain from contact heat during placebo analgesia ( Wager et al., 2004 ). Together, this evidence indicates that the late phase is related to perceptual intensity of noxious stimuli. 
 
 
 Caveats 
 BOLD responses in other brain regions previously shown to correlate with pain intensity, such as parts of insula and anterior cingulate cortex, were not significantly related to either Heat or Pain VAS reports. A likely possibility is that nuisance covariates, which modeled signals within white matter and cerebrospinal fluid, may have captured some variance associated with stimulus-related brain activity. This was found to be the case in our dataset (data not shown). These nuisance covariates thus resulted in a conservative estimate for areas that are involved in Heat and Pain intensity coding. Note that we focused on detecting differences between Heat and Pain correlations, and do not contest the correlation between brain activity and pain intensity. 
 While our results appear indicate that perception of pain may (1) arise from cognitive valuation of stimulus properties such as heat, or (2) reflect the cumulative effect of several distributed processes, other nuanced interpretations are also possible. Previous studies in patients have shown that direct electrical stimulation of the insula and S2 can produce pain ( Mazzola et al., 2011 ). Thus, pain can arise from discrete, localized areas of neural activity, though it may not be possible to cleanly separate pain from heat sensation in this manner. Also, patients with lesions incorporating posterior insula and S2 have shown impaired pain and temperature detection ( Greenspan et al., 1999 ), indicating either disruption of serial processing of stimulus encoding or co-localization of function. Another possibility is that pain reports may not correlate as well with BOLD responses simply because brain activity may be a purer measure of heat and/or nociceptive signals than perceptual reports of pain, which are influenced by cognitive and evaluative processes. And finally, the relationship between Heat vs. Pain reports and brain activity may reflect different profiles of nonlinearity of the two percepts with the BOLD signal itself. Clearly, further study is required to address such issues. 
 
 
 Conclusions 
 This study indicates that late phase BOLD responses to contact heat in contralateral S1 and S2 are significantly better correlated with heat intensity than pain intensity. Dividing hemodynamic responses into early, interval, and late revealed different patterns of brain activation that may reflect different aspects of the experience of pain and stimulus processing (i.e. salience/affect, cognitive/evaluative, and sensory/discriminative). Our results urge caution when interpreting BOLD responses elicited by painful stimuli as “pain processing”, especially when pain is associated with other perceived stimulus properties.

 Figure 1 
 
 Derivation of hemodynamic response function (HRF) based on scout dataset (n = 4 subjects). The axial brain image shows significant activation of the scout dataset for the “high painful heat” condition (Z > 2.3 [uncorrected for multiple comparisons]). Significant S1 activation in the scout dataset was identified by considering significant activation within left postcentral gyrus as identified by the probabilistic Harvard-Oxford Cerebral Atlas at > 25% likelihood (green). A trial average response was calculated for voxels with significant contralateral S1 activation. Curve fitting divided the HRF explanatory variable (EV) into four parts (e1, e2, e3, and e4) using 3 splits points. The lower row shows the component EVs before and after gamma convolution. Note that e1 and e2 each represent adjacent and discrete samples in time, though they clearly formed a compound early phase in the HRF best fit. The set [e1, e2] was replaced with [e2, de2] to model the early phase. Refer to methods for details. A=anterior, L=left, P=posterior, R=right. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 2 
 
 Psychophysical and stimulus data (n = 12 subjects). Perceptual ratings of heat intensity and pain intensity were statistically differentiable (two way repeated measures ANOVA [VAS modality, stimulus level], VAS modality F(1)=6.367, p<0.05). Line graphs highlight within-subject differences in stimulus/ratings vs. prescribed perceptual levels, with each line color representing a different subject. Line colors assigned to each subject are consistent across each line graph. Box plots highlight the median and distribution across subjects, and were generated by the same data as their neighboring line graphs. The horizontal line within each box represents the median measurement, upper and bottom bounds of each box correspond to the upper and lower quartile range, and the whiskers indicate the complete range of samples. Box plots and prescribed perceptual levels are color-coded based on whether they are innocuous (blue) or painful (red). 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 3 
 
 The temporal evolution of group activation to the “high painful heat” condition across the modeled HRF response. A conventional group analysis using a monophasic gamma-convolved EV for the same dataset is shown below for comparison. Significant activations were thresholded at Z > 2.3, p<0.05 (cluster-corrected threshold). ACC=anterior cingulate cortex, AnG=angular gyrus, aINS=anterior insula, IFG=inferior frontal gyrus, INS=insula, M1=primary motor cortex, S2=secondary somatosensory cortex, SMG=supramarginal gyrus, Thal=thalamus. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 4 
 
 Perceptual ratings correlate with late phase responses across all scans for the six perceptual levels (n = 12 subjects, 72 scans). Early and interval phases exhibited no significant correlations with heat or pain ratings. The general linear model used regressors for heat and pain intensity ratings in the same model, and accounted for within-subject variation. Significant correlations to heat ratings were detected in the somatosensory cortices contralateral to stimulus application. Significant correlations to ratings are colored red-yellow (Z > 2.3, p<0.05 [cluster-corrected threshold]), and significant contrasts for Heat > Pain correlations are green (Z > 2.3, p<0.05 [cluster-corrected threshold]). No significant contrast was observed for Pain > Heat correlations. COp=central opercular cortex, M1=primary motor cortex, MTG=middle temporal gyrus, PTm=planum temporale, PoCG=postcentral gyrus, PrCG=precentral gyrus, S1=primary somatosensory cortex, SMG=supramarginal gyrus, STG=superior temporal gyrus, Thal=thalamus.
