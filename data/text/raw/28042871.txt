Abnormalities within the dopamine system may contribute to these disturbances and pharmacologically targeting the D3 dopamine receptor (DRD3) is therefore of significant clinical interest. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the acute effects of the DRD3 antagonist GSK598809 on anticipatory reward processing, using the monetary incentive delay task (MIDT), and response inhibition using the go/no-go task (GNGT). A double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover-design approach was used in abstinent alcohol dependent, abstinent poly-drug dependent and healthy control volunteers. For the MIDT, there was evidence of blunted ventral striatal response to reward in the poly-drug dependent group under placebo. GSK598809 normalised ventral striatal reward response and enhanced response in the DRD3 rich regions of the ventral pallidum and substantia nigra. Exploratory investigations suggested that the effects of GSK598809 were mainly driven by those with primary dependence on alcohol but not opiates. Taken together, these findings suggest that GSK598809 may remediate reward deficits in substance dependence. For the GNGT, enhanced response in the inferior frontal cortex of the poly-drug group was found. However, there were no effects of GSK598809 on the neural network underlying response inhibition, nor were there any behavioural drug effects on response inhibition. Conclusion GSK598809 modulated the neural network underlying reward anticipation but not response inhibition suggesting DRD3 antagonists may restore reward deficits in addiction. Introduction Evidence suggests dysregulation of neurobiological networks involved in reward processing and inhibitory control contributes to the risk and maintenance of addiction and relapse during abstinence. Disturbances in reward functioning involve hypo-responsivity to non-drug reward which is associated with increased craving, drug use and brain response to drug-related stimuli ( Blum  et al , 2000 ;  Lubman  et al , 2009 ;  Wrase  et al , 2007 ). Failures of impulse control across a range of domains have been a consistent finding in addiction and are associated with relapse ( Taylor  et al , 2016 ). fMRI studies implicate reduced recruitment of lateral and medial prefrontal regions in impaired impulse control ( Forman  et al , 2004 ;  Kaufman  et al , 2003 ), although enhanced recruitment has been found in those who have successfully achieved abstinence from cocaine ( Connolly  et al , 2012 ). Abnormalities in reward and impulse control may be effects of blunted dopamine signalling in addiction ( Trifilieff and Martinez, 2014 ). Reductions in dopamine release and receptor density are associated with increased drug use and craving and may precede the development of addiction ( Casey  et al , 2014 ;  Heinz  et al , 2004 ). Dopamine plays a pivotal role in reward-related behaviours, mediating reward learning ( Schultz, 1998 ) and ‘incentive salience’ of reward stimuli ( Robinson and Berridge, 1993 ). Deficits in dopamine neurotransmission may impair impulse control, as low striatal D2/D3 binding is associated with increased impulsivity in rodents and humans ( Clark  et al , 2012 ;  Ghahremani  et al , 2012 ). Drugs increasing extracellular dopamine improve response inhibition in cocaine and alcohol dependence ( Garrison and Potenza, 2014 ) . These lines of evidence suggest increasing brain dopamine may be a useful therapeutic strategy for addiction ( Nutt  et al , 2015 ). The D3 receptor (DRD3) is preferentially expressed within ventral striatal and limbic
brain regions involved in reward processing. In vitro studies demonstrate the
highest density of DRD3s within the ventral striatum of the human brain ( Gurevich and Joyce, 1999 ) whereas in-vivo human
positron emission tomography (PET) studies demonstrated maximal DRD3 density within
the ventral pallidum, followed by the substantia nigra and ventral striatum, with
lower levels in thalamus and dorsal striatum ( Tziortzi  et al , 2011 ). Exposure to drugs of abuse
results in upregulation of DRD3 in rodent models of addiction ( Le Foll and Di Ciano, 2015 ). Upregulated DRD3 density has been
found within the ventral striatum and substantia nigra in a post-mortem study of
cocaine dependence ( Staley and Mash, 1996 ),
while upregulated nigral DRD3s correlated positively with impulsivity and risky
decision making in stimulant dependence ( Boileau
 et al , 2012 ;  Payer
 et al , 2014 ). Trends for upregulated ventral
pallidal DRD3 have been found in both alcohol dependence and heavy stimulant use
( Boileau  et al , 2012 ;
 Erritzoe  et al , 2014 ).
Consequently, there is much interest in this receptor as a target for drug
therapy. DRD3 antagonists have shown promise in preclinical studies, reducing self-administration, cue-induced drug-seeking, and conditioned place preference ( Heidbreder and Newman, 2010 ). In clinical populations, the novel DRD3 antagonist GSK598809 transiently reduced craving in nicotine dependence ( Mugnaini  et al , 2013 ) and attentional bias for food cues in low restrained eaters ( Nathan  et al , 2012 ). The exact mechanism by which DRD3 antagonists achieve these effects is currently unknown, although there is evidence the DRD3 is an autoreceptor controlling the synthesis and release of dopamine ( Diaz  et al , 2000 ;  Zapata and Shippenberg, 2002 ). Blockade of DRD3 with GSK598809 may therefore increase extra-synaptic dopamine. The ICCAM Platform study is a multicentre research study that aimed to 1) identify brain
networks underlying addiction to alcohol, cocaine and opiates and relapse
vulnerability and 2) identify potential new treatments for addiction based upon
their ability to modulate these networks. Here, we present the effects of GSK598809
on networks underlying the anticipation of reward, using the monetary incentive
delay task (MIDT;  Knutson  et al ,
2000 ) and response inhibition using the go/no-go task (GNGT;  Garavan  et al , 2002 ). We
hypothesised that reward and inhibitory control disturbances would be found in
abstinent drug dependent individuals and that GSK598809 would mitigate such
disturbances. Patients and Methods Participants Participants were recruited as part of the ICCAM multi-centre study. Detailed
description of recruitment and participant characteristics are described
elsewhere ( Paterson  et al. 
2015 ). Briefly, substance dependent individuals were recruited
according to the following criteria: aged 20-64 years, meeting DSM-IV ( American Psychiatric Association, 2000 ) for
current or prior alcohol, cocaine or opiate dependence, abstinent for at least 4
weeks, free from any current primary axis-1 mental health disorder, no history
of severe enduring mental illness, no psychoactive medications, no serious
physical health problems, no neurological disease and no contraindications for
MRI scanning. Healthy controls (HC) were recruited according to the same
criteria except they no had current, or history of dependence to any drug except
nicotine. 88 participants completed both placebo and GSK598809 sessions: a healthy control group (n=35), an abstinent alcohol dependent (AD) (n=20) and an abstinent poly-drug dependent (PD) group (n=33). Five people were excluded from the MID analysis, and 14 from the GNG analysis leaving final Ns of 83 and 74 respectively (see  supplementary materials  for details). The HC group was matched with the AD and PD groups for age, sex, smoking status and handedness and additionally with the AD group, but not the PD group, for IQ and years of education (see  Tables S1 and S2 ). AD and PD groups differed significantly for age for the MID analysis, with a trend for a difference for the GNG analysis ( p =0.06). Procedures and tasks Procedures are described in detail elsewhere ( Paterson
 et al , 2015 ). Briefly, the ICCAM study involved
5 separate scanning sessions (one screening, including fMRI scanning to
familiarise participants with the scanner environment and tasks, and four drug
testing sessions). Placebo and GSK598809 (60mg) were administered in a
double-blind manner with a cross-over design. Owing to concerns over study
dropout and loss of placebo data, a weighted randomization was used with the
placebo session administered in study session 2 or 3 whereas GSK598809 was
administered in session 4 or 5 (with the other two sessions testing other drugs
as part of the ICCAM platform;  Paterson
 et al , 2015 ). The mean (SD) inter-session
interval between placebo and GSK598809 sessions was 34.39 days (40.91) (MIDT)
and 36.15 days (42.72) (GNGT), with no difference between groups; MIDT
(F(2,80)=0.25,  p =0.78), GNGT (F(2,71) = 0.03,
 p =0.98). Scans occurred 2 hours after administration of drug or placebo and tasks were practised before scanning. All participants had an alcohol breathalyser reading of 0.0%. Participants were urine screened. A positive test for cannabis was allowed due to its long half-life provided there was no use in the previous week. Participants tested negative for all other drugs with two allowed exceptions (see  supplementary materials ). Tasks Both the MIDT and GNGT are described in detail within the  supplementary
materials . The MIDT was modified from  Knutson  et
al.  2000  and was designed to probe reward sensitivity.
Participants could win or lose money (or neither win nor lose) depending upon
how quickly they reacted to a target stimulus that was predicted by a win, loss
or neutral cue. The task was designed such that win accuracy would be 66% and
£10 would be won at each session. The GNGT was an event-related task adapted from  Garavan
et al. 2002 , consisting of a series of letter Xs and letter Ys.
Participants were instructed to respond as fast as they could to each letter (Go
trial) except when the letter was the same as the previous letter (No-Go
trial). Analysis of Behavioural data For the MIDT, reward-neutral reaction time (RT) was analysed. For the GNGT, percentage
accuracy for Go trials, No-Go trials and RT for Go trials were analysed. All
analyses used mixed ANOVAs with drug session as the within-subject factor and
group as the between-subject factor. Age was included as a mean-adjusted
covariate in all analyses. Analysis of fMRI data Details of data acquisition and preprocessing are in  supplementary
materials . For the MIDT, analysis focused on the ‘cue and anticipation’ phase and was
modelled as a mini-block beginning at the cue onset and ending at the onset of
the target stimulus (see  supplementary materials  for details). The contrast of interest is
the average of the ‘reward cue anticipation’ compared with
‘neutral cue anticipation’ across both runs. For the GNGT successful inhibitions of No-Go trials (“stops”) and
unsuccessful nogos (“errors”) were modelled against an implicit
baseline of Go trials. Stops that were preceded by a Go trial that also did not
have a response were considered “fake inhibitions” and were
modelled separately as conditions of no-interest. The task was powered to look
at “stops” rather than “errors” therefore only the
“stops>go” contrast is explored further. Realignment parameters and movement outliers (scan to scan displacement of >3mm) were added to the models as nuisance regressors. A region of interest (ROI) approach was used. ROIs of the ventral striatum (VS), ventral
pallidum (VP) and substantia nigra (SN) were chosen for the MIDT due to their
key roles in reward processing ( Haber and
Knutson  et al.  2010 ) and evidence of abnormalities
within these regions in addiction. Additionally, as reviewed above, these
regions are particularly rich in DRD3s and therefore are potential targets for
GSK598809 effects. For the GNGT, bilateral inferior frontal gyri (IFG) and
anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) were chosen due to their key role in motor
inhibition ( Aron  et al ,
2003 ) and abnormal recruitment in addiction. Although not key ROIs
for this task, exploratory investigations were also carried out with the DRD3
rich regions of the VS, VP and SN. Mean reward-neutral (MID) and stop-go (GNG) contrast estimates were extracted from the relevant ROIs for each participant and entered into mixed ANOVAs (see  supplementary materials  for details). A Bonferroni correction for the 3 regions investigated for each task was applied, with significance set at  p <0.017. Additional exploratory whole-brain investigations were carried out using a voxel-wise threshold of  p <0.05, Family Wise Error Corrected. (See  figure 1  for ROIs and  supplementary materials  for further details). Correlational analyses were additionally carried out to investigate relationships
between ROI brain response and performance, reward and impulsivity variables,
ROI brain response and duration of abstinence, and drug effects on ROI response
and performance (see  supplementary materials  for details). Twenty nine analyses were
carried out therefore Bonferroni-corrected significance was set at
 p <0.0017. Results MID Behavioural There were no significant drug or group effects or interactions for MID performance (see  figure S1 ). MID fMRI Effect of Task The reward-neutral contrast for each group for both the placebo and GSK598809 conditions revealed a highly significant network of activation, including the VP, VS and SN, in line with previous studies ( Knutson et al 2000 ). See  figure S3 . Effects of group and drug: whole brain analysis Mixed ANOVAs demonstrated a significant main effect of drug within the left VP, caudate
and cerebellum ( Table 1  and  Figure S5 ). These effects
appear to be driven by increased reward-neutral anticipation response in the
GSK598809 session compared to the placebo session, in particular for the AD
group and to a lesser extent the PD group. However these apparent interactions
were not significant. A significant effect of drug was also observed in the right middle frontal gyrus
(corresponding to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC, see  table 1  and  figure S5 ), which was
driven by a significant group by drug session interaction. GSK598809 increases
reward-neutral BOLD response to a greater degree in the AD group compared to
both the HC and the PD groups. ROI analysis Mixed ANOVAs demonstrated a main effect of drug within the VS
( p =0.005), VP ( p <0.001) and SN
( p =0.009) ( Table 1 ).
These effects are due to increased reward-neutral BOLD response in the GSK598809
session compared to the placebo session ( Figure
2 ). Whilst these effects appear to be mainly driven by the dependent
groups in each ROI, only a trend for a drug by group interaction was found, and
only in the ventral pallidum ( p =0.041,  Table 1 ). Post-hoc paired t-tests revealed a significant
effect of GSK598809 on ventral pallidum reward-neutral BOLD response within the
AD group ( p <0.001) and PD group
( p =0.003) but not the HC group ( p =0.145). No significant main effects of group were found although trends were found within the VS
and SN ( p  = 0.048 and 0.042 respectively).  Figure 2  suggests these effects were driven by blunting
occurring within the placebo condition of the PD group. Exploratory post-hoc
investigations carried out with the placebo session data only demonstrated a
significant main effect of group in the VS,
F(2,79)=5.03, p =0.009, PD<HC) and a trend for a
significant blunting in the SN that just fell short of Bonferroni corrected
significance, (F(2,79)=4.01, p =0.022, PD<HC). Post hoc
tests revealed no difference or trends between AD and HC or AD and PD. No group
effects or trends emerged for corresponding analysis of the GSK598809
session. Additional exploratory investigations were carried out within the ROIs, separating the
groups by primary drug of dependence (see  supplementary materials ).
This suggested that drug effects were driven by participants with a primary
alcohol but not opiate dependence (see  figure S7 ). Investigations into primary cocaine dependence
were not carried out owing to small numbers. GNG Behavioural There were no significant drug or group effects or interactions for GNG performance (see  figure S1 ). GNG fMRI - Effect of Task The stops>go contrast for each group for both the placebo and GSK598809 conditions revealed a highly significant network of activation, in line with previous studies using this task ( Garavan  et al , 2002 ). See  figure S4 . Effects of group and drug: whole-brain analysis Whole-brain analyses using mixed ANOVAs revealed a significant group effect within the left cerebral peduncle region of the midbrain due to increased activation in the AD group ( figure S6 ). No drug effects or interactions were found. ROI analysis There was no effect of GSK598809 in any of the ROIs. A main effect of group was found in
the right IFG ( p =0.015), and at trend level in the left IFG
( p =0.036), driven by hyper-activation in the PD compared
with the HC group ( p =0.016). See  Figure 3  and  Table 1 . Exploratory analysis revealed no significant effects of GSK598809 in DRD3 rich regions (VS, VP, SN). Correlational Analyses Ventral striatal ROI activation during the placebo condition for the MIDT, in all
participants, correlated with impulsivity measured by the Barratt Impulsivity
Scale (BIS) ( Patton  et al ,
1995 ) (r= -0.368,  p =0.001) but not the reward
responsivity subscale of the BISBAS ( Carver and
White, 1994 ) ( Table
S4 ). To rule out the possibility of this negative association being
primarily driven by group differences, an additional correlation was carried out
within the healthy control group only, which supported this negative
relationship (r= -0.372,  p  = 0.033). No correlations were found
with any of the GNG ROIs ( Table S3 and S4 ). No relationships were found between the MID and
GNGT ROI activation or fMRI and questionnaire behavioural measures ( Table S4 ) or with
duration of abstinence ( Table
S5 ). No relationship was found between the effect of GSK598809 on VP
activation and MID performance ( Table S6 ). Discussion This study aimed to investigate the effects of the selective DRD3 antagonist GSK598809
on networks involved in the anticipation of reward and response inhibition. The main
findings were that GSK598809 significantly increased reward-neutral anticipatory
responses for the MIDT but had no effects on brain response during response
inhibition. Group effects were found for both tasks, although in opposite directions. Blunting of
the VS in the PD group, and DLPFC response in the AD group, was found for the MIDT
under placebo. Enhanced inferior frontal response in the PD group and enhanced
midbrain response in the AD group was found for the GNGT. There were no effects of
either drug or group on task performance, therefore all reported differences in BOLD
response occur in the context of normal performance. MID Deficits in ventral striatal reward-related signalling are hypothesised to confer
vulnerability to addiction and relapse ( Trifilieff and Martinez, 2014 ;  Blum
 et al  2000 ). We found blunted ventral striatal
response in the PD group, and an overall negative correlation between VS
response and impulsivity. Reduced MID VS response associated with increased
impulsivity has been previously demonstrated in alcohol dependence ( Beck  et al , 2009 ;  Wrase  et al , 2007 ),
therefore our finding adds to a growing literature supporting the reward
deficiency hypothesis of addiction. In contrast to the studies above, we did not
find significant blunting in the AD group. This could suggest recovery with
long-term abstinence in our cohort; however we did not find a significant
association between length of abstinence and ventral striatal response in the AD
group, perhaps owing to small sample size. There was a general restorative or enhancing effect of GSK598809 on reward anticipatory
BOLD response. This finding is in line with evidence suggesting that D3
receptors may act as autoreceptors, inhibiting dopamine synthesis and release
( Diaz  et al , 2000 ;
 Zapata and Shippenberg, 2002 ). It has
been hypothesised that tonic extracellular dopamine may inhibit phasic dopamine
reward signalling via action on autoreceptors ( Grace, 1991 ). This may explain the opposing effects on MID reward
anticipatory BOLD response of GSK598809 and amphetamine, which releases
dopamine. Amphetamine increases  tonic  dopamine levels but
decreases reward anticipatory BOLD response ( Knutson  et al , 2004 ). In contrast, by blocking D3
autoreceptors, GSK598809 may enhance  phasic  dopamine reward
signalling ( Sokoloff  et al ,
2006 ) and reward anticipatory BOLD response. This reward enhancing
effect of dopamine autoreceptor blockade is supported by a recent study
demonstrating low doses of the D2/D3 antagonist amisulpride (chosen to result in
preferential autoreceptor blockade) increased MIDT reward responsivity in
depressed patients ( Admon  et al ,
2016 ). Despite these BOLD enhancing effects of GSK598809, no behavioural effects were found.
This may reflect ceiling effects as the behavioural requirements of the MIDT are
very simple - reaction times were unimpaired in the placebo condition suggesting
that participants were already performing at maximum capacity for a speeded
motor response. Furthermore, 60mg of GSK598809 results in only partial DRD3
blockade ( Erritzoe  et al ,
2014 ), therefore behavioural effects may emerge with increasing
dose. Although no significant drug by group interactions were found, the effects of GSK598809
appeared to be largely driven by drug and alcohol dependent groups rather than
controls (especially within the DRD3 rich ventral pallidum where a strong trend
to an interaction was observed). These patterns may be due to upregulation of
DRD3s in stimulant and alcohol dependence ( Boileau  et al , 2012 ;  Erritzoe  et al , 2014 ;  Payer  et al , 2014 ;  Staley  et al , 1996 ) and
evidence of enhanced dopamine autoreceptor actions in response to chronic
exposure to alcohol ( Siciliano  et
al , 2016 ). While requiring replication in a larger
sample, exploratory investigations raised the intriguing possibility that
GSK598809 may be relatively ineffective in opiate dependence. At the time of
writing, we were unable to find any published studies on DRD3 density in human
opiate addicts. However, in contrast to the increases in DRD3 expression in
rodents after alcohol and cocaine exposure ( Le
Foll and Di Ciano 2015 ), a very recent study demonstrated that heroin
exposure decreases DRD3 expression ( Zhu
 et al , 2016 ), possibly explaining the apparent
reduced efficacy of GSK598809 in those with a primary opiate dependence. In addition to effects within DRD3 rich regions, whole brain analyses revealed effects
within the caudate, cerebellum and DLPFC. In-vivo PET studies do not report high
DRD3 levels within these regions. An enhanced MIDT reward anticipatory caudate
response was also found with DRD3 receptor blocking doses of amisulpride ( Admon  et al , 2016 ). There
is evidence supporting the caudate, lateral prefrontal regions and cerebellum to
be important regions mediating the integration of motivation with goal directed
behaviour ( Harsay  et al ,
2011 ;  Schutter, 2013 ;  Watanabe and Sakagami, 2007 ). Enhanced
activation within these regions may therefore be a downstream consequence of
GSK598809’s effects on the VS and VP, regions critically involved in
incentive motivation ( Haber and Knutson,
2010 ;  Smith  et al ,
2009 ). Together, these findings suggest hypo-functioning of reward signalling in substance
dependence. Evidence suggests, in alcohol and stimulant dependence, that this
may be caused, in part, by excessive D3 autoreceptor inhibition of dopamine
systems. GSK598809 may ameliorate reward deficits by disinhibiting these
systems. GNG In contrast to GNG studies demonstrating prefrontal hypo-activation and impaired
response inhibition in current dependence, we found hyper-activation of lateral
prefrontal regions (PD group), or midbrain (AD group) together with unimpaired
behavioural performance. Our results are consistent with two other studies in
cocaine and alcohol abstinence ( Bell  et
al , 2014 ;  Connolly
 et al , 2012 ). They perhaps reflect recovery of
prefrontal structure and function in successful abstinence owing to cessation of
drug use and cognitive control practices ( Garavan  et al , 2013 ). Whether this
hyper-activation, which is also found in relatives of alcohol patients, is
protective for relapse or an addiction vulnerability marker is unknown. However
fMRI hyper-activation during cognitive tasks has been reported in detoxified
alcohol dependent participants who subsequently abstained, but not in those who
relapsed ( Charlet  et al ,
2014 ), supporting the notion that prefrontal hyper-activation may be
protective. Despite previous studies suggesting a link between over-expression of DRD3s and
increased impulsivity as measured by questionnaire ( Payer  et al , 2014 ), we found no evidence
to suggest GSK598809 modulated performance or neuronal response of the network
underlying response inhibition. This may be due to the multifaceted nature of
impulsivity, with DRD3s affecting some impulsivity measures but not response
inhibition as measured here. We found no association between a questionnaire
measure of impulsivity and GNG brain response or performance. Furthermore,
whilst mood-related impulsivity correlates more strongly with D2/D3 binding in
the ventral rather than dorsal striatum in pathological gamblers ( Clark et al 2012 ), response inhibition
correlates with receptor binding in the dorsal (where DRD3 density is low) but
not the ventral striatum ( Ghahremani  et
al,  2012 ). These findings suggest different impulsivity
measures have different underlying neuro-circuitry. Prefrontal regions are
important for response inhibition ( Aron
 et al , 2003 ;  Garavan  et al , 2013 ), again regions where DRD3s are
low. Low DRD3 density in regions implicated in response inhibition may explain
the lack of a modulatory effect of GSK598809 in our study. We additionally
carried out exploratory investigations within the DRD3 rich regions for the
GNGT. However, no effects of GSK598809 were found. These findings suggest that
D3 agents selectively modulate brain mechanisms of incentive motivation. Limitations The main limitation of the study was the introduction of an order confound, arising from
(ultimately groundless) concerns over study dropout. However, practice and
habituation effects were minimised by all participants having carried out the
tasks in full within the scanner at screening (placebo session was either the
second or third task scanning session), and the tasks being practised outside
the scanner before each session. A post-hoc exploratory ROI analysis was carried
out within the anterior insula, a region considered to process salience and
therefore likely to be sensitive to habituation effects. Notably the anterior
insula is reliably implicated in MID performance (in a meta-analysis performed
by our group) but is devoid of DRD3s. No effects of GSK598809 or interactions
were found within this region, supporting the suggestion that the effects seen
were indeed drug effects rather than non-specific habituation effects. Another
limitation is the age difference between the AD and PD groups (consistent with
typical clinical presentation) therefore caution should be used when
interpreting AD vs PD differences. Conclusion GSK598809 enhances reward anticipatory BOLD response to non-drug rewards within abstinent substance dependent groups, with strongest effects in those with a primary alcohol dependence. These results have implications for considering D3 antagonism as a potential treatment for normalising reward deficiencies in substance dependence.

B) ROIs for the GNG task, left/cyan shows the right inferior frontal gyrus, middle/green shows the left inferior frontal gyrus, and right/purple shows the anterior cingulate. Figure 2 ROI response during the MID task: mean reward-neutral anticipation BOLD contrast estimate for both the placebo and the GSK598809 sessions. White bars represent the placebo session whereas light grey/blue (when in colour) represent the GSK598809 session. Hisograms on the top show the main effect of drug within each ROI (*= significant at p<0.01, **= significant at p<0.001) whereas histopgrams below show the BOLD contrast estimates for the placebo and GSK598809 sessions for each group separately (†=significant effect of group at p<0.01 in the placebo condition only). . Error Bars indicate within-subject standard error of the mean ( Cousineau and O’Brien, 2014 )) suitable for assessing drug rather than group effects. Figure 3 ROI response during the GNG task: mean ‘stops-go’ BOLD contrast estimate within each ROI for the placebo (white bars) and the GSK598809 (grey or blue when in colour) sessions. Error Bars indicate within-subject standard error of the mean ( Cousineau and O’brien 2014 ). * = main effect of group, significant at a Bonferroni corrected value of  p < 0.017.
