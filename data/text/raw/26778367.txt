 Externalizing psychopathology has been linked to prefrontal
abnormalities. While clinically diagnosed subjects show altered frontal gray
matter, it is unknown if similar deficits relate to externalizing traits in
non-clinical populations. We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to
retrospectively analyze the cerebral gray matter volume of 176 young adult
social to heavy drinkers (mean age= 24.0 ± 2.9, male= 83.5%)
from studies of alcoholism risk. We hypothesized that prefrontal gray matter
volume and externalizing traits would be correlated. Externalizing personality
trait components— Boredom Susceptibility-Impulsivity (BS/IMP) and
Empathy/Low Antisocial Behaviors (EMP/LASB)— were tested for
correlations with gray matter partial volume estimates (gmPVE). Significantly
large clusters ( p FWE  < 0.05, family-wise
whole-brain corrected) of gmPVE correlated with EMP/LASB in dorsolateral and
medial prefrontal regions, and in occipital cortex. BS/IMP did not correlate
with gmPVE, but one scale of impulsivity (Eysenck I 7 ) correlated
positively with bilateral inferior frontal/orbitofrontal, and anterior insula
gmPVE. In this large sample of community-dwelling young adults, antisocial
behavior/low empathy corresponded with reduced prefrontal and occipital gray
matter, while impulsivity correlated with increased inferior frontal and
anterior insula cortical volume. These findings add to a literature indicating
that externalizing personality features involve altered frontal
architecture.

 1. Introduction 
 Externalizing psychopathology is marked by the outward expression of
maladjustment, causing harm to others. Latent dimensional analysis of common
psychiatric diagnoses shows that antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), conduct
disorder (CD) and substance use disorders fall into a clear externalizing dimension
( Kotov et al., 2011 ;  Krueger, 1999 ;  Krueger and Markon, 2006 ). The behavioral disinhibition and impulsivity
that pervade these disorders (e.g., see  Krueger and
South, 2009 ) suggest deficits in prefrontal brain— the region
most implicated in behavioral control ( Knutson et
al., 2015 ). 
 For example, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggests that antisocial
personality disorder is marked by an 11% reduction in prefrontal gray matter
volume ( Raine et al., 2000 ). Adolescent
conduct disorder is characterized by functional and structural changes in brain
areas related to emotion (amygdala, insula, striatum, orbital cortex,  Fairchild et al., 2011 ;  Fairchild et al., 2013 ;  Sarkar
et al., 2013 ;  Sebastian et al.,
2012 ). Changes in prefrontal volume have been associated with aggressive
behavior and callousness in CD, with aggressive behaviors being negatively
correlated with right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex volume, and emotional
callousness being positively correlated with bilateral orbitofrontal cortex volumes
( Fairchild et al. 2013 ). In a relatively
small sample of adult psychiatric patients with mixed externalizing disorders, motor
impulsiveness was also related to lesser orbitofrontal gray matter ( Lee et al., 2011 ). 
 Studying healthy community-dwelling subjects without clinical diagnoses,
 Cho et al., (2013)  reported an
association between gray matter volume and impulsivity in 34 young adults, with
greater impulsivity linked to reduced medial prefrontal, dorsolateral prefrontal and
ventral striatal gray matter volumes. An inverse relationship between trait
impulsiveness and orbitofrontal gray matter volume in middle age adults has also
been reported ( Matsuo et al., 2009 ).  Walhovd et al. (2012)  similarly showed a
negative correlation between conduct problems and left orbitofrontal and
supramarginal gyri thickness in children and adolescents. In the large European
IMAGEN trial of community dwelling adolescents, externalizing behaviors were related
to lower gray matter in left inferior and middle frontal gyri ( Montigny et al., 2013 ), and impulsivity traits related to
reductions in orbitofrontal gray matter volume ( Schilling et al., 2013b ) and superior frontal gyrus cortical thickness
( Schilling et al., 2013a ). As opposed to
self-reported impulsivity, experimentally measured reward impatience (delay
discounting) is associated with reduced lateral prefrontal volume in healthy adults
( Bjork et al., 2009 ). Thus, even in
healthy individuals who are not the focus of clinical attention, there seem to be
relationships between regional brain volume and externalizing personality traits.
However, the largest samples are limited to children and adolescents, in whom
neocortical development continues in to late adolescence and early adulthood
(particularly in the frontal lobes,  Groeschel et
al., 2010 ;  Lenroot and Giedd,
2006 ). That is, these relationships between personality traits and brain
volume might not persist into adulthood, or perhaps assume a different nature.
Moreover, the personality assessments have usually been limited to one particular
scale, which limits the dimensionality with which facets of impulsivity can be
assessed. 
 In this study, we examined a large sample of 176 physically healthy young
adults with structural MRI and several personality scales of trait impulsiveness and
antisocial behaviors, which were analyzed with principal component analysis. Our
primary goal was to employ voxel based morphometry (VBM) and analyze relationships
between personality components and gray matter partial volume estimates (gmPVE).
However, rather than studying clinically diagnosed patients or controls without any
indication of pathology, our sample is instead comprised of subjects from
neuroimaging studies of alcoholism risk and heavy drinking— a population in
which impulsivity and antisocial behaviors are more prevalent ( Finn, 2002 ;  Haber et al.,
2005 ;  Kendler et al., 2003 ;  Krueger and South, 2009 ;  Moss et al., 2007 ;  Young et
al., 2000 ). We hypothesized that trait impulsivity and antisocial
behavior would negatively correlate with prefrontal gmPVE. Secondarily, and given
the nature of the sample, we also investigated the effects of alcohol use and
familial alcoholism on these externalizing personality components, and on gmPVE. 
 
 
 2. Methods 
 The research procedures in this work were conducted after obtaining from all
subjects written informed consent; both the consent form and procedures were
approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Indiana University. All
procedures were conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration
of Helsinki. 
 
 2.1 Subjects 
 This study includes the anatomic brain imaging data acquired from 176
subjects who had previously participated in five different functional MRI or PET
neuroimaging studies of alcoholism risk, as conducted at the Indiana University
School of Medicine (including those subjects published in  Kareken et al., 2012 ;  Kareken et al., 2010 ;  Kareken et
al., 2013b ;  Oberlin et al.,
2013 ;  Oberlin et al., 2014 ).
One hundred and seventeen of these subjects had participated in studies that
involved pulsed arterial spin labeling MRI of regional cerebral blood flow; this
subsample was recently reported in ( Weafer et
al., 2015 ) to examine relationships between resting brain physiology
and impulsive personality traits. The aggregate sample ( Table 1 ) is predominantly male (147 men, 29 women).
Exclusion criteria comprised self-reported evidence of neurological disorders of
central origin, self-report of symptoms consistent with mood or anxiety
disorders, psychoses, bipolar disease, or current psychiatric treatment,
including any psychoactive medication. At the time of the study, none of the
participants were seeking treatment for alcoholism or had developed drug
dependence through their lifetime. All subjects had data from the
Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism (SSAGA,  Bucholz et al., 1994 , see below), and 16
(9.1%) subjects satisfied criteria for a lifetime diagnosis of DSM-IV
alcohol dependence. Although subjects with histories of illicit drug use were
enrolled, 171 (97.2%) tested negatively on urine screens for
psychoactive drug use, with 4 (2.3%) testing positive for marijuana, and
1 (0.6%) for opiates. Based on information from the SSAGA, 34 subjects
(19.3%) described using marijuana or hashish at least 21 times. The
majority ( n = 157; 89.2%) were non-smokers. 
 
 
 2.2 Measures 
 
 2.2.1 Subject assessment 
 All subjects were characterized with the SSAGA, using trained raters
who underwent observation before examining subjects. The SSAGA’s
Family History Assessment Module (FHAM) was used to assess each
subject’s family history of alcoholism (only the subject was
available to assess family history), and the Timeline Followback interview
was used to measure subjects’ recent drinking (TLFB,  Sobell et al., 1986 ) over 90 days prior
to study participation. Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT,
 Saunders et al., 1993 ) data were
available for 169 subjects. Family history of alcoholism was categorized as:
1) Family history positive (FHP) having at least one first degree affected
relative; 2) A more ambiguous family history (FHAmbig) consisting of one or
more second degree affected relatives; and 3) A negative family history of
alcoholism (FHN), as defined by no affected first or second degree
relatives. Subjects with mothers who were affected with probable dependence
were excluded to rule out fetal alcohol effects. 
 
 
 2.2.2 Personality trait measurement 
 Externalizing traits and self-reported behaviors were assessed with:
 (1)  the Zuckerman Sensation Seeking Scale ( Zuckerman, 1994 ) whose subscales
reflect enjoyment of socially conventional adventure and thrill seeking
(Thrill/Adventure Seeking), a liking of less conventional and more unusual
sensory experiences (Experience Seeking), a preference for occasions that
afford the opportunity to “let loose” (Disinhibition), and a
tendency to bore easily with repetitive or sedate activity (Boredom
Susceptibility),  (2)  the Eysenck I 7  ( Eysenck et al., 1985 ) Impulsivity
scale, whose subscales reflect a tendency to act without thinking
(Impulsiveness), adventure seeking (Venturesomeness), and emotional concern
for others (Empathy), and  (3)  an in-house, computerized
modification of Section M of the SSAGA semi-structured interview on which
subjects endorsed or denied a variety of antisocial acts occurring after the
age of 15 (total ranging from 0 – 44, see  Oberlin et al., 2012 ). These instruments were adapted
to a computer self-administration format using E-Prime software (Psychology
Software Tools, Inc, Sharpsburg, PA). For all scales, higher scores
represent a greater magnitude of the measured trait. 
 
 
 2.2.3 MRI acquisition 
 Imaging was performed in a Siemens (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen,
Germany) 3T Magnetom Trio-Tim scanner with a 12-channel head coil array at
the Center for Neuroimaging of the Indiana University School of Medicine. A
whole-brain high resolution anatomical MRI was collected using a 3D
Magnetization Prepared Rapid Acquisition Gradient Echo (MP-RAGE) with
imaging parameters optimized according to the ADNI (Alzheimer’s
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) protocol, and as implemented in a large
cohort study of Alzheimer’s disease, mild cognitive impairment and
normal subjects (160 sagittal slices in 9.14 minutes, 1.0 × 1.0
× 1.2 mm 3  voxels). 
 
 
 
 2.3 Analyses 
 
 2.3.1 Personality trait data 
 As a data reduction strategy, principal component analysis with
varimax rotation (SPSS, v. 20) was conducted on the antisocial behavior
inventory and the subscales of the Zuckerman Sensation Seeking and Eysenck
I 7  inventories. As some variables were abnormally skewed,
they were transformed prior to inclusion in the PCA using the most
appropriate transformation to reduce skewness (square root transformation
for antisocial behavior count and Venturesomeness from the Eysenck
I 7 ; Log10 transformation for Thrill and Adventure Seeking
from the Sensation Seeking Scale). Personality data were derived from an
original superset of 198 subjects who had participated in these studies (165
men; mean age 24.3, SD=3.2). However, 22 of these subjects were eventually
excluded from the VBM analyses given either incomplete data about their
marijuana use (n=14) or imaging data that were acquired using a different
head coil (n=8). 
 
 
 2.3.2 Image processing 
 The optimized VBM method ( Good et
al., 2001 ) was implemented within SPM8 (Wellcome Trust Centre for
Neuroimaging) by first segmenting brain tissues into gray matter, white
matter and cerebrospinal fluid. Subsequently, each subject’s gray
matter images were normalized to the MNI gray matter template using a
modulation step to adjust for spatial distortions introduced by non-linear
image deformations. The gray matter images were then smoothed using a 12mm
full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) isotropic Gaussian kernel, which allows
the application of cluster-level statistics ( Silver et al., 2011 ). Estimated total intracranial volume (eTIV)
was derived from FreeSurfer version 5.1 ( https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FreeSurferMethodsCitation )
and used as a covariate to adjust for inter-individual differences in head
size in the VBM analysis (see below). Freesurfer eTIV was employed, as it
has a higher correlation with the gold standard of manual measurements than
does SPM8 eTIV ( Malone et al.,
2015 ). 
 
 
 2.3.3 Image analyses 
 A multiple regression model in SPM8 was implemented to perform
voxel-wise correlations between personality traits components derived from
the PCA (independent variables of interest) and gmPVE from the modulated
images. Given the centrality of impulsivity (acting without adequate
thought/planning) and antisocial (socially deviant) behaviors in alcohol use
disorders (rather than social use, per se,  Finn, 2002 ;  Gunn et al.,
2013 ), we focused the analyses on the two components that
predominantly loaded on trait impulsivity and the endorsement of antisocial
acts. The regression model also included covariates to control for any
effects from age (inverse transformed to minimize skewness), gender,
drinking (drinks/week, square root transformed to minimize skewness), eTIV
(as reported by FreeSurfer), smoking status, and lifetime marijuana/hashish
use of greater than 21 times, as derived from the SSAGA. Smoking and
marijuana use were both dummy-coded as binary variables. 
 Statistical inferences for VBM were made using cluster statistics
( p FWE  < 0.05, correcting for
whole brain gray matter family-wise error [FWE]) with the cluster-forming
(height) threshold  p  < 0.001 (uncorrected,  Silver et al. 2011 ). The mean cluster
values of each significant region were extracted for all subjects using
MarsBar ( Brett et al., 2002 ) at the
cluster forming threshold to illustrate the nature of significant
relationships between average gmPVE and personality components, and to
assure that they were not driven by outliers. 
 
 
 
 
 3. Results 
 
 3.1 Personality Traits 
 After performing principal components analysis (PCA) on the antisocial
behavior count, and the subscales of the Eysenck I 7  and Sensation
Seeking Scale ( Table 2 ), three principal
components emerged with eigenvalues greater than 1.0 that explained
64.9% of the total variance after varimax rotation ( Table 3 ). The components and their pattern
of loadings can be characterized as dimensions of: 1) Boredom Susceptibility and
Impulsivity (BS/IMP), 2) Thrill Seeking (TS), and 3) High Empathy and Low
Antisocial Behaviors (EMP/LASB). 
 
 
 3.2 Relationships between gmPVE and Personality Traits 
 BS/IMP was neither positively nor negatively correlated with gray matter
volume at FWE-corrected cluster level significance. Given our recent finding of
an inverse relationship between right prefrontal (premotor) regional cerebral
blood flow and Eysenck I 7  impulsivity subscale ( Weafer et al. 2015 ), we secondarily examined this scale
individually, and also found no significant inverse relationship between gmPVE
and impulsivity. There was, however, a left frontal cluster where the
I 7  impulsivity subscale was  positively  related
to gmPVE in the inferior frontal/posterior-lateral orbitofrontal and insula
areas; a similar cluster was present on the right, albeit of trend level
significance ( p FWE  = 0.065;  Figure 1 ,  Table
4 ). 
 Four clusters (three frontal) of gmPVE correlated positively with
EMP/LASB: a left dorsolateral prefrontal region, a right dorsolateral prefrontal
cluster, and a left ventromedial prefrontal region ( Figure 2 ;  Table 5 ).
The remaining cluster was in occipital cortex ( Table 5 ). There were no clusters of negative correlation between
gmPVE and EMP/LASB. 
 
 
 3.3 Relationships between alcohol use, familial alcoholism, personality
traits, and gmPVE 
 Average number of drinks/week from the Timeline Followback interview was
related positively with BS/IMP (Spearman’s rho, ρ= 0.37,
 p < 0.001), negatively with EMP/LASB (ρ=
-0.16,  p = 0.03), but unrelated to TS (ρ= 0.13,
 p = 0.09). Average drinks/drinking day showed similar
relationship with BS/IMP (ρ= 0.20,  p = 0.008), EMP/LASB
(ρ= -0.21,  p = 0.006); and TS (ρ= 0.06,
 p = 0.42). The AUDIT was related with BS/IMP (ρ=
0.43,  p < 0.001), but not with TS or EMP/LASB
( p s > 0.11). 
 One-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) showed small, but significant mean
differences between the three family history groups (FHP,  n =
62; FHAmb,  n = 45; and FHN,  n = 69) in age
( F 2,173  = 6.3,  p = 0.002;
FHP=23.4, SD= 2.5; FHAmb= 24.9, SD=3.6; Tukey’s lease significant
difference [LSD],  p = 0.019), but not education, or any of the
personality components ( F s < 1.9,  p s
> 0.16); the FHA groups also did not differ in gender
(χ 2 = 1.3,  p  > 0.5). The family
history groups were, however, different in drinks/week
( F 2,173  = 3.9,  p = 0.022) and
AUDIT scores ( F 2,173  = 5.2,  p  =
0.006), although not in drinks/drinking day. Tukey’s LSD showed that for
drinks/week, FHN subjects (14.7, SD= 10.8) were lower than FHAmb (19.1, SD=
11.0,  p  = 0.038). For AUDIT, FHN subjects (9.3, SD=4.3) were
lower than both FHAmb (12.1, SD=5.4) or FHP (11.9, SD=6.0;  p s
< 0.02). As analyzed in separate SPM ANOVA models (co-varying for age,
gender, drinks/week, smoking, cannabis use, and eTIV), there were no differences
between the three family history groups in gmPVE. 
 There were no significant clusters of correlation between the SPM model
covariates of drinks/week, smoking, or cannabis use and gmPVE. 
 
 
 
 4. Discussion 
 In this retrospective sample of undiagnosed community-dwelling subjects
recruited for studies of risky drinking, we tested for significant relationships
between frontal gmPVE and impulsive/externalizing personality traits. We reasoned
that such a sample should increase the variance of these traits ( Finn, 2002 ;  Haber et al. 2005 ;  Kendler et al.
2003 ;  Krueger and South, 2009 ;
 Moss et al. 2007 ;  Young et al. 2000 )— a rationale supported by the
statistically significant relationships in this sample between drinking and the
derived externalizing personality components comprising elements of impulsivity
(BS/IMP) and antisocial behavior (EMP/LASB). We hypothesized that elevated trait
impulsivity and antisocial behaviors would negatively correlate with prefrontal gray
matter volume as observed in externalizing disorders. 
 
 4.1 Relationship between BS/IMP and gmPVE 
 Unlike prior studies ( Boes et al.,
2009 ;  Cho et al., 2013 ;  Lee et al. 2011 ;  Matsuo et al. 2009 ;  Schilling et al. 2013a ;  Schilling et
al. 2013b ;  Walhovd et al.,
2012 ), including a smaller study of patients diagnosed with DSM-IV
alcohol abuse and matched controls ( Asensio et
al., 2015 ), we did not find that gmPVE correlated negatively with
self-reported impulsive behavior, either as a function of our BS/IMP component
(consisting of significant loadings from scales reflecting boredom
susceptibility, impulsive acts, antisocial behaviors, social disinhibition, and
a desire to seek out unusual experiences), or when looking specifically at the
Impulsivity subscale of the Eysenck I 7  inventory. The Impulsivity
subscale of the Eysenck I 7  inventory did, however, correlate
positively with bilateral gmPVE in lateral/posterior orbital cortex and insula.
While not a typical finding, some studies have reported positive correlations
between impulsiveness and either insula or medial frontal gray matter (e.g.,
 Cho et al. 2013 ;  Kaag et al., 2014 ;  Lee et al. 2011 ). Differences in sample characteristics,
age or approach to measuring impulsivity could account for the contradictory
results found between the literature and our study (e.g., many studies use the
Barratt Impulsivity Scale,  Barratt,
1959 ). 
 
 
 4.2 Relationship between EMP/LASB and gmPVE 
 We found significantly large clusters where frontal gmPVE
(dorsolateral prefrontal extending into the ventromedial and insula areas)
correlated with EMP/LASB. Of note, neither of the independent scales of Eysenck
I 7  empathy or antisocial acts (the primary constituents of the
EMP/LASB component) was significantly associated with gray matter volume when
examined independently. This suggests that statistically aggregating these
anti-correlated elements allowed detecting a behavioral phenotype that is more
reflective of gray matter structure. 
 Empathy (which by I 7  inventory items includes elements of
“emotional contagion,” perspective taking, and sympathy)
dominates the EMP/LASB component. In the clinical neurological literature, the
loss of the ability to empathize can result from acquired lesions of
ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( Hillis,
2014 ;  Shamay-Tsoory et al.,
2003 ). In 118 healthy young adults,  Banissy et al. (2012)  found that empathic concern was associated
with  reduced  gray matter volume in the left precuneus, left
inferior frontal gyrus/insula, and left anterior cingulate. However, a large
study of 261 children (ages 5 – 15 years) found that parent-rated
empathy derived from the Children's Empathy Quotient and Systemizing
Quotients scale ( Auyeung et al., 2009 )
correlated positively with gray matter volume in the left fronto-opercular and
superior temporal cortex ( Sassa et al.,
2012 ; also see  Sterzer et al.,
2007 ). Most recently, higher “affective empathy”
(experiencing others’ emotions) in 176 undergraduate psychology majors
was associated with increased gray matter density in the insula, while
“cognitive empathy” (understanding others’ motivations)
was related to higher gray matter density in the middle cingulate and
dorsomedial prefrontal cortex ( Eres et al.,
2015 ). 
 Antisocial acts loaded negatively on the EMP/LASB component, and the
absence of empathy is a component of antisocial personality disorder and
sociopathy. That is, the EMP/LASB component can be interpreted as the inverse of
a sociopathic personality constellation. In this context, a number of studies
have shown that, compared to controls, there is reduced frontal gray matter and
amygdala volume in subjects with ASPD, violent offenders, and criminal
psychopaths ( de Oliveira-Souza et al.,
2008 ;  Gregory et al., 2012 ;
 Laakso et al., 2002 ;  Müller et al., 2008 ;  Pardini et al., 2014 ;  Raine et al. 2000 ;  Tiihonen
et al., 2008 ). Similar anatomic locations have been implicated in 23
boys (ages 10 – 13), in whom callous-unemotional traits were related to
increased gray matter concentration in medial orbital and anterior cingulate
cortex, and increased gray matter volume and concentration in the bilateral
temporal lobes ( De Brito et al., 2009 ).
In this case, the relative increase in gray matter in children might reflect
competitive pruning during cortical maturation ( Lenroot and Giedd, 2006 ). In older adolescent boys with conduct
disorder (ages 16 – 21),  Fairchild et
al. (2011)  found gray matter volume reductions in the amygdala and
insula. The same group also noted gray matter reductions in adolescent girls
with conduct disorder in the bilateral insula and right striatum, with
aggressive CD symptoms negatively correlating with right dorsolateral prefrontal
volume, but callous traits correlating positively with orbital volume ( Fairchild et al. 2013 ). 
 A connection between antisocial behavior and dorsolateral prefrontal
neocortex is certainly intuitive, as this region is well known to regulate the
ability to plan, regulate, shift strategy, and exert cognitive inhibitory
control ( Fuster, 1997 ). However,
antisocial activity often comprises a lack of empathy and regard for
others’ well-being. In that vein, our findings extended into ventral
regions of prefrontal cortex, where acquired brain lesions are most likely to
result in violence ( Grafman et al.,
1996 ). Ventromedial frontal cortex also activates during moral reasoning
( Shenhav and Greene, 2014 ), and
lesions to this region most alter decisions in ethical dilemmas where subjects
must decide upon actions that result in harm to others ( Koenigs et al., 2007 ;  Thomas et al., 2011 ). A key aspect to the ventromedial prefrontal
cortex here is its role in coding the visceral sensations experienced when
contemplating both the loss of assets when gambling ( Bechara et al., 1999 ), and harm caused to others by
one’s behaviors ( Moretto et al.,
2010 ). Given our results and others’ findings, it is then
possible that reduced ventromedial frontal gray matter interfere with the
visceral sensations that occur when contemplating how one’s actions
affect others’ well-being. 
 In addition to the frontal findings, the whole brain VBM identified an
occipital cluster that was highly correlated with the EMP/LASB component.
Although not obviously implicated in disorders of behavioral control,
alterations in these regions have been identified in CD and ASPD populations.
 Bertsch et al. (2013)  showed that
across different types of ASPD subjects there were common clusters of reduced
gray matter volumes within the frontal pole and the occipital cortex.  Sundram, et al. (2012)  observed reduced
white matter integrity in the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (the white
matter tract connecting the frontal lobe and the posterior portion of the
inferior occipital gyrus) in the right frontal lobe of ASPD subjects. Moreover,
this altered white matter integrity was negatively correlated with measures of
psychopathy.  Dalwani et al.’s
(2011)  work also showed that boys with serious CD and substance use
problems have lower gray matter volume in left DLPFC and right lingual gyrus
(but higher gray matter volume in the right precuneus). A first step in empathy
is to perceive another’s emotional state, and such visual processing
centers play an important role in the visual identification of facial emotion
( Kitada et al., 2010 ). One could then
speculate that visual centers might, in this way, relate to empathy. 
 
 
 4.3 Personality traits, alcohol use, familial alcoholism, and gmPVE 
 Finally, although the externalizing personality traits did relate to
drinking, neither alcohol consumption itself nor familial alcoholism was
significantly related to gmPVE. Many studies have shown significant gray matter
loss in the prefrontal cortex of alcohol-dependent individuals (up to
20% in the dorsolateral frontal cortex, e.g.,  Chanraud et al., 2006 ;  Fein
et al., 2002 ;  Pfefferbaum et al.,
1997 ). Given the nature of our sample, however, the lack of our own
findings might well be accounted for by the limited range of drinking and the
lack of heavy, chronic exposure. Some studies have also shown that
alcohol-naïve subjects from high-risk families have alterations in
frontal gray and white matter volumes ( Cservenka, 2015 ). For example,  Benegal et al. (2007)  found that the alcohol naïve offspring
of alcoholic parents, when compared to controls, had significantly smaller
volumes of superior frontal and cingulate areas, with the left superior frontal
gyrus volume correlating with externalizing symptoms. Hill’s group has
found that the offspring of alcoholic relatives had lower [right > left]
asymmetry ratios of combined gray and white orbital volume, and that orbital
white matter asymmetry in these offspring correlated with greater impulsivity
( Hill et al., 2009 ). The same group
( Hill et al., 2001 ,  2013 ) and  Dager et al (2015)  also detected loss of right amygdala volume in
the adolescent offspring of families with alcoholism. Most recently,  Cservenka et al (2015)  reported that family
history density was related to left nucleus accumbens volume in adolescents,
although only in girls. Our large smoothing kernel may have precluded us from
detecting effects in smaller subcortical regions. Having said that, we did
observe a small subthreshold effect (299 voxels at p< 0.005) in the
right amygdala, where FHP subjects had reduced gmPVE when compared to FHN
subjects (similar to the Hill and Dager studies above). A second consideration
in our lack of findings related to this genetic risk is familial density of
affected relatives, as subjects in our study could have only one first-degree
affected relative, whereas the density of affected relatives in other studies
was higher (e.g.,  Hill et al. 2001 ;  Hill et al. 2009 ). Also, only the subject
was available to interview with regard to family history, without the added
reliability from interviewing collateral family. This could affect the nature of
the family history outcome. 
 
 
 4.4 Limitations 
 Although our study is comprised of a large sample of well characterized
subjects, it has limitations. First, the predominantly male sample complicates
generalizing the findings to women. Second, given that the subjects were
selected for their elevated drinking, it may not be possible to generalize these
results to samples characterized by more social levels of alcohol consumption.
Some subjects with lower empathy and higher antisocial behavior were in the age
range of 27 – 35, making it difficult to tease out interactions
between age and these other factors. 
 
 
 4.5 Conclusions 
 This study of 176 young healthy drinkers found significant relationships
between dorsolateral/ventromedial prefrontal and occipital gray matter volume
and a personality trait component reflecting a combination of high empathy and
low sociopathic behavior. Trait impulsivity was unexpectedly associated with
increased lateral inferior frontal/insular gray matter volume. Thus, aspects of
externalizing personality traits in community-dwelling non-patients are, as in
clinical samples, related to regional differences in frontal and limbic gray
matter volume.

 p -values < 0.001 uncorrected). Cluster
statistic reflects a greater number of contiguous voxels exceeding height
threshold ( p < 0.001, uncorrected) than expected by
chance, controlling for whole brain family-wise error (FWE).

 Highlights 
 
 
 
 ➢ 
 We tested for relationships between externalizing behaviors and gray
matter volume. 
 
 
 ➢ 
 High empathy/low sociopathic behavior correlated with frontal gray
matter. 
 
 
 ➢ 
 Impulsivity positivity correlated with frontal/insula gray matter
volume. 
 
 
 ➢ 
 Frontal gray matter is related to externalizing personality
traits.
