 In visually guided grasping, possible hand shapes are computed from the geometrical features of the object, while prior knowledge about the object and the goal of the action influence both the computation and the selection of the hand shape. We investigated the system dynamics of the human brain for the pantomiming of grasping with two aspects accentuated. One is object recognition, with the use of objects for daily use. The subjects mimed grasping movements appropriate for an object presented in a photograph either by precision or power grip. The other is the selection of grip hand shape. We manipulated the selection demands for the grip hand shape by having the subjects use the same or different grip type in the second presentation of the identical object. Effective connectivity analysis revealed that the increased selection demands enhance the interaction between the anterior intraparietal sulcus (AIP) and posterior inferior temporal gyrus (pITG), and drive the converging causal influences from the AIP, pITG, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to the ventral premotor area (PMv). These results suggest that the dorsal and ventral visual areas interact in the pantomiming of grasping, while the PMv integrates the neural information of different regions to select the hand posture. The present study proposes system dynamics in visually guided movement toward meaningful objects, but further research is needed to examine if the same dynamics is found also in real grasping.

 Introduction 
 Neural mechanisms of visuomotor transformation in grasping have been uncovered in detail ( Binkofski, et al. 1998 ;  Culham, et al. 2003 ;  Ehrsson, et al. 2000 ;  Fogassi, et al. 2001 ;  Gallese, et al. 1994 ;  Grol, et al. 2007 ;  Luppino, et al. 1999 ;  Murata, et al. 1997 ;  Murata, et al. 2000 ;  Raos, et al. 2006 ;  Rizzolatti, et al. 1988 ;  Sakata, et al. 1995 ;  Verhagen, et al. 2008 ), but we still poorly understand how we select one grasping hand shape from the multiple possibilities by integrating the object meaning and the goal of the action ( Castiello and Begliomini 2008 ;  Cisek and Kalaska 2010 ;  Fagg and Arbib 1998 ;  Rizzolatti and Luppino 2001 ). The present fMRI study aimed to reveal the system dynamics of the brain during the pantomiming of grasping hand shape formation in humans using dynamic causal modeling (DCM) analysis ( Friston, et al. 2003 ). 
 The subjects pantomimed grasping an object either by pinching with the thumb and index finger (precision grip) or by gripping it between the palm and all the fingers and thumb (power grip) according to symbols drawn on photographs of graspable objects used in everyday life ( Fig 1 ). The experimental tasks were designed to emphasize two aspects in grasping. One is the interaction of the visuomotor transformation in the dorsal visual stream and the object recognition in the ventral visual stream ( Goodale and Milner 1992 ;  Ungerleider and Haxby 1994 ) evoked by the use of objects for daily use. Given that grasping an object is often the first action in goal-directed behavior, semantic memory retrieval of the target object (such as the purpose, use, and various intrinsic properties of the object) can be involved in the hand preshaping. Indeed, a recent anatomical study in macaques reported the connection between the anterior intra parietal area (AIP) and the ventral visual areas ( Borra, et al. 2008 ), suggesting their interaction is highly likely. 
 The other aspect of emphasis is the selection of the grip hand shape. To enhance the neural activities for selection, we employed a psychological technique that increases or decreases the selection demand in the hand grip formation. Crucially, each object was shown twice in the same session and the grip in the second presentation of the objects was the same as or different from the initial grip type (i.e., precision or power grip). When the same grip is requested for the identical object, brain activation for the second movement is expected to be smaller than for the first, as in the neural adaptation observed in various modalities ( Chong, et al. 2008 ;  Grill-Spector, et al. 2006 ;  Hamilton and Grafton 2006 ;  Kilner, et al. 2009 ;  Koutstaal, et al. 2001 ;  Shmuelof and Zohary 2005 ). By contrast, when a different grip is requested in the second presentation, the implicit memory of the first response to this object will compete with the current grip selection, thereby increasing the activity in areas relevant to grip selection, as shown in previous studies in the language domain ( Thompson-Schill, et al. 1997 ;  Thompson-Schill, et al. 1999 ). We expected that the increased selection demands would enhance both the regional activities and the inter-regional dynamic causal relations in the selection of the grip. 
 
 
 Method 
 
 Subjects 
 Sixteen young, right-handed, healthy subjects were examined (nine males and six females). Handedness was assessed with the Edinburgh Inventory (males: mean 97.9, range 79 – 100, females: mean 100, Oldfield, 1971). For males, the mean age was 22.4 years old and the range was 19- 27 years old, and the mean 22.3 and the range 19-24 for females. All had no history of neurological disorders. The experimental procedures were approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the University of Tokyo and by that of Hamano Life Science Research Foundation Ogawa Laboratories for Brain Function Research. Written informed consent was given by all subjects. 
 
 
 Stimuli 
 Subjects were presented color photographs of 168 common objects used or found at home, such as tools, cooking utensils, pans, cups, saucers, toys, vegetables, fruits, food, bottles, tubes, cans, stationary, bags, accessories etc ( Fig. 1 ). The photographs were taken against a black background. Trademarks or logos on the objects were blurred to make them unreadable. All the objects were projected onto a screen in the size of 5° × 5° so that information about the size of the objects was not available in the images. The subjects were informed that all the objects were a graspable size, but they needed to recognize the objects in order to make the correct grasping movements, especially for the apertures between the thumb and the index finger (precision grip) or between the thumb and other fingers (power grip). 
 
 
 
 Experimental conditions 
 
 The first precision grip condition (PRE1) 
 The subjects were instructed to mime the precision grip movement with the right hand as if the object projected onto the screen was close to their right hand so that they did not need to reach for it. Subjects were instructed to make the aperture between the index finger and the thumb, the grip force, and the orientation of the wrist as appropriate as possible for the objects presented. In order to help them to carry out the grasping movements without the objects, we advised them to recall/imagine the object properties such as size, shape, weight, texture of the surface, purposes of use, how to use etc. The position to place the index finger and the thumb was indicated by one or two yellow asterisks (*) drawn on the picture ( Fig. 1 ). All the objects presented in this condition were new to them. 
 
 
 The first power grip condition (POW1) 
 The subjects were instructed to mime the grasping movement to the presented objects in the picture by opposing the thumb and all fingers to the palm of the right hand without a reaching movement. Except for the type of grip, the subjects were instructed to perform the task the same as in the PRE1 condition. The position to put the palm was indicated by a yellow bar symbol ( Fig. 1 ) drawn on the picture. Since no indication as to where to put the thumb and fingers was provided, the subjects had to decide this by themselves. All the objects presented in this condition were new to them. 
 
 
 The second precision grip condition (PRE2same) 
 The subjects performed the same precision grip movements as in the PRE1 condition. The difference between the PRE1 and the PRE2same conditions was that the objects presented in the PRE2same had already appeared in the PRE1 so that the subjects made the same grasping movements to the objects seen and gripped previously. 
 
 
 The second power grip condition (POW2same) 
 Equivalent to the PRE2same condition, the subjects performed the power grip movements again with the objects already presented in the POW1 condition. 
 
 
 The precision grip with preceding power grip condition (PRE2diff) 
 The subjects performed the precision grip movements as in the PRE1 condition, but the objects to be grasped had already been presented in the preceding the POW1 condition. Therefore, the subjects made precision grip hand movements to the objects for the first time, but they had already made power grip movements to the same objects in the preceding blocks. 
 
 
 The power grip with preceding precision grip condition (POW2diff) 
 This condition was the opposite of the PRE2diff condition. The subjects performed a power grip with the objects that had been presented and processed in the PRE1 condition. 
 
 
 Baseline condition 
 The subjects were instructed to fixate their eyes on a small white point located in the center of a black background. 
 
 
 
 Experimental design 
 The experiments were designed as block-design fMRI experiments. The subjects had three separate sessions with fifty-six distinct different objects assigned to each session. In a session, half of the fifty-six objects were used in the PRE1 condition and the rest were in the POW1 condition. Half of these twenty-eight objects used in the PRE1 condition were presented in the PRE2same condition, and the other half were in the POW2diff condition. Similarly, the twenty-eight objects appearing in the POW1 condition were divided into two halves, one for the POW2same and the other for the PRE2diff. One trial had a duration of 4 s and the picture of the objects were presented for 4 s. Seven trials, with a 2 s blank screen after the last trial, comprised one block, with a total duration of 30 s. One session had a total of 20 blocks, which consisted of four PRE1, four POW1, two PRE2same, two PRE2diff, two POW2diff, two POW2same and four baseline conditions. The baseline condition was presented every fifth block. The order of the conditions was randomized between three sessions, but blocks for the PRE1 and the POW1 conditions tended to concentrate in the early halves of the sessions due to the definition of the conditions. 
 
 
 Experimental procedure 
 The subjects were instructed on the tasks before the fMRI sessions. The precision grip and power grip were demonstrated by the experimenter to them using a few objects that did not appear in the fMRI experiments. None of the objects shown in the fMRI sessions were presented to the subjects before scanning. Stimulus presentation was programmed with Presentation 0.80 software (Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc., Albany, California, USA) on a Windows notebook PC (Dynabook G5/X16PME, Toshiba, Tokyo, Japan). Stimuli were projected through an LCD projector (PRO Xtrax LP-XF31 Multiverse projector, SANYO, Tokyo, Japan) onto the back of a screen. The subjects viewed the images on the screen that stood above the head through a mirror attached to the head-coil. To prevent head motion, a vacuum pillow or a viscoelastic foam pillow was laid under the head. Hand movements were recorded by video from the outside of the scanner room through the window for off-line evaluation of performance. To make the hand visible to the video camera, foam pads were put under the right forearm while keeping the elbow in contact with the bed. 
 
 
 Image acquisition 
 EPI data were acquired with a Siemens Allegra operating at 3.0 T (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). The whole brain was covered with 5.0 mm thick 20 axial images with 1.0 mm gaps (TR = 1.2 s, TE = 30 ms, Flip angle = 80°, FOV = 24 × 24 cm 2 , 64 × 64 matrix). The subjects had three sessions of fMRI scanning with 480 volumes per session. A total of 1440 volumes were collected in about 40 min. Structural high-resolution images of the subjects’ heads were also collected between the experimental sessions with a three-dimensional MPRAGE sequence (TR = 2800 ms, TE = 4.38 ms, TI = 1300ms, Flip angle = 8°, FOV = 24 × 24 cm 2 , 256 × 256 matrix, axial 128 slices, 1.3 mm thick). 
 
 
 Preprocessing of structural and functional MRI data 
 The first five volumes of each fMRI session were discarded to eliminate magnetic saturation effects, and a total of 475 volumes per session were used. The data analysis was carried out using SPM8 (available at  http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/ ) on Linux PC workstations. Structural images were normalized using the DARTEL procedure ( Ashburner 2007 ), in which individual structural images are segmented into gray and white matter, and a mean image from each individual’s image serves as templates. The DARTEL normalization proceeds in 6 steps with increasing spatial resolution, with the final step for the linear transformation into MNI space. This process yielded normalized individual structural images in 1 × 1 × 1 mm 3  resolution. For the later use of individual normalized images as the target images, the images were smoothed with a 2 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. For preprocessing of the functional data, EPI images were realigned to the first image and resliced. Then the difference in the slice acquisition time was corrected and the volumes were resliced again. We normalized individual structural and functional data using the individual structural images that were normalized by DARTEL as the target images. The functional images were normalized with resampling at 3 × 3 × 3 mm 3  and smoothed with a 6 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. 
 
 
 Within-subject ANOVA of functional MRI data 
 Each subject’s haemodynamic responses induced by the task blocks were modeled with a box-car function with duration of 30 s and convolved with a haemodynamic function that reaches a peak 6.0 s after the stimuli onset. The global mean intensity of each session was normalized to 100. Confounds by global signal changes were removed by applying a high pass filter with a cut-off cycle of 128 s. Signal increase relative to the baseline in the POW1 and the PRE1 of each participant was estimated according to the general linear model. The signal differences between the second and the first presentation were estimated by the contrast of POW2same-POW1, POW2diff- POW1, PRE2same- PRE1, and PRE2diff- PRE1. These four difference contrast images of all subjects were submitted to the second level (group) analysis, a 2 × 2 within subject ANOVA with factors GRIP-CHANGE (DIFFERENT/SAME) and TYPE (POW/PRE) with correction for nonsphericity. Main effects and interactions were tested with t-tests since we were interested in the effects with the direction. Statistical inferences were drawn at p < 0.05 at cluster level: The statistical maps (SPM{T}) were thresholded at p < 0.001 (not corrected) for intensity, and then thresholded by cluster size (50 contiguous voxels). We also calculated the ‘effect of interest’ contrast that is an F tests on the four difference contrast images with the null hypothesis that all the images are equal to zero. This test reveals voxels in which at least one of the difference contrasts images are significantly non-zero. 
 
 
 Dynamic causal modeling 
 
 1. VOI selection 
 To understand the effective connectivity between the activated regions, we performed a dynamic causal model (DCM) analysis ( Friston, et al. 2003 ). We constructed DCM models with the five volumes of interest (VOIs), namely the ventral premotor area (PMv), anterior intraparietal area (AIP), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), posterior inferior temporal gyrus (pITG), and primary visual area (V1) in the left hemisphere were selected to construct twenty-eight alternative DCMs. The rationale for selecting these five VOIs is as follows. The PMv and AIP are included in the model as the core nodes for grasping, as has been established in macaque studies ( Luppino, et al. 1999 ). The DIFF > SAME contrast in the ANOVA revealed the pITG as well as PMv and AIP, suggesting that the selection of grip hand shape involves the pITG which locates in the ventral stream for object recognition ( Grill-Spector, et al. 1998 ;  Grill-Spector, et al. 2000 ). We modeled connection between the AIP and pITG based on a recent macaque anatomical study in which tracer arrived at the inferotemporal cortex (TE, TEpd, TEm, and TEa) ( Borra, et al. 2008 ). In addition to these three regions, we model the two nodes that take input of the visual signal (V1) and input of the experimental instruction (DLPFC). The V1 was selected since it serves as the common source of the dorsal and ventral visual streams, and also as the first cerebral gate to the visual input which spreads into the cerebral cortex. We used a focus in the V1 revealed in the effect of interest contrast. For simplicity of the models, we did not include the V2, V3/V3A and the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) that may relay the dorsal signal from the V1 to AIP ( Nakamura, et al. 2001 ). These omitted dorsal regions may also have communication with the ventral visual stream, but we consider that the interaction of the two visual streams can be represented, at least in part, by the interaction between the AIP and pITG. 
 The DLPFC activation was significant for the interaction in the ANOVA and also in the effect of interest contrast. We interpret the DLPFC activities may reflect the processing of the visual symbols that specify where and how to grip the object. Hence, we modeled the DLPFC as a node that receives the grip-type instructions, namely the SAME/DIFF and the PRE/POW categorical signals. As for the connections, we modeled the connection of DLPFC-AIP based on the recent anatomical study in macaque ( Borra, et al. 2008 ). Although we do not have unequivocal experimental evidence that support a direct anatomical connection of the PMv-pITG and DLPFC-PMv ( Rizzolatti and Luppino 2001 ), we incorporated these connections in the models and tested if they are likely by means of the random effect Bayesian model selection procedure ( Penny, et al. 2004 ). All the connections were modeled as bidirectional. 
 
 
 2. Time series data extraction from the VOIs 
 First, we reanalyzed the functional data with new design matrices. New design matrices explicitly encoded the input and the two modulatory effects to conform to the neural state model in the DCM analysis. In the DCM analysis, the context-dependent modulation of connections and driving input to the system are modeled explicitly and separately. In practice, the experimental blocks were regrouped into the input, and the two modulatory effects (GRIP-CHANGE and TYPE). For the input, all second presentation blocks [the POW2same, POW2diff, PRE2same, and PRE2diff conditions] were encoded with 1 and the first presentation [POW1 and PRE1] were 0. For the modulatory effect by GRIP-CHANGE, DIFFERENT was encoded with 1 and SAME was with 0. For the modulatory effect by TYPE, POW as 1 and PRE as 0. The six motion parameters were also modeled as covariates of no interest in the design matrices. The effect of interest was calculated as the F contrast (SPM{F}) of the input and the two modulatory effects. The null hypothesis (H 0 ) of this effect of interest contrast is that the estimates of the three effects are all equal to zero, thus the rejection of the H 0  means at least one effect is significantly non zero. 
 Second, the time series data were extracted from the five VOIs that showed significant activation by this effect of interest F contrast. The individual VOIs were created as 6 mm radius spheres with centers that were the closest individual maxima to the group maxima identified in the ANOVA. The coordinates of group maxima (in MNI space) were taken from the effect of interest contrast in the ANOVA as follows: PMv (−42 8 31), AIP (−48 −37 46), DLPFC (−45 32 25), pITG (−48 −52 −8), V1 (−9 −94 −8)). The coordinates of the AIP were selected as a local maximum that fall within the anatomical criteria of AIP, namely the junction of the intraparietal sulcus and the posterior central sulcus ( Binkofski, et al. 1998 ). The coordinates of the pITG was obtained from the DIFF > SAME contrast in the ANOVA ( Table 2 ). The distance between the individual maxima and the group maxima were as follows: PMv (mean 0.83 mm, SD 1.4 mm), AIP (0.38, 1.0), DLPFC (0.89, 1.7), pITG (0.83, 1.5) and V1 (0,0). All the individual maxima were found within 6 mm from the group maxima. The F contrasts were thresholded with p < 0.05 without correction and the VOI time series data were extracted as the first principal component of the supra-threshold voxels’ time series data in the spherical VOI. The VOI time series were adjusted for the effect of interest; the signal change attributed to the motion parameters were subtracted from the time series data. 
 
 
 3. Model estimation and comparison 
 A total of twenty-eight DCMs were estimated and compared ( Fig 4A-C ). In all models, the V1 receives the driving input, and the DLPFC received DIFF/SAME and the POW/PRE categorical signals. The connections PMv-AIP, AIP-V1, and pITG-V1 were supposed to exist in all models ( Fig 4A ). The connections DLPFC-AIP, DLPFC-PMv, and DLPFC-pITG were allowed to have seven variations ( Fig 4B ), and the connections PM-pITG and AIP-pITG were allowed four variations ( Fig 4C ), thereby resulting a total of twenty-eight models. All connections were modeled as bidirectional (i.e., PMv-AIP means both PMv→AIP and AIP→PMv), and modulation by the factors GRIP-CHANGE and TYPE was allowed on all connections except the self-recursive ones. The all individual DCM estimates were submitted into the random effects Bayesian model selection procedure ( Penny, et al. 2004 ) separately for each session. The DCM estimates of connection strengths of the best model were averaged over sessions by the Bayesian approach and evaluated by one-sample t-tests with a statistical threshold of p < 0.05 with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. 
 
 
 
 Results 
 
 Behavioral data 
 Each movement of each subject was evaluated whether the hand posture followed the instruction symbols (precision or power grips) and whether the details such as aperture and wrist angle were changed from one trial to the next. Eleven of sixteen subjects performed the miming of grasping without errors. The mean error rate was 2.0 % ± 3.3 % SD. 
 
 
 MRI data 
 Firstly, we compared brain activation during the first presentation (PRE1 and POW1) against the baseline condition. Similar brain networks were active during the first grasp of objects by precision grip (PRE1) and power grip (POW1) ( Fig 2A and B ). As expected, we found activation in the PMv, AIP, as well as the primary motor area (M1), dorsal premotor area (PMd), postocentral gyrus (PoCG), inferior parietal lobule (IPL), posterior inferior temporal gyrus (pITG), supplementary motor area (SMA), thalamus and cerebellar hemispheres (Cer). Secondly, the direct comparison revealed that the POW1 activation was higher than the PRE1 in the PMv, AIP, pITG, and other regions ( Fig 2C ). The reverse contrast (PRE1 > POW1) did not detect significant activation. Thirdly, we performed a within-subject ANOVA on the contrast images for the REPETITION effects, namely POW2same-POW1, POW2diff- POW1, PRE2same- PRE1, and PRE2diff- PRE1. A significant interaction was found in the PMv, DLPFC, and AIP along with other cortices lining the intraparietal sulcus ( Fig 2E ,  Table 1 ). The interaction reflects a signal increase exclusively in the PRE2diff condition compared to the signal decrease in the other three conditions ( Fig 3 ). The main effect of GRIP-CHANGE was found in the PMv, AIP, and pITG in a t contrast for DIFF > SAME ( Fig 2F and 2H  left,  Table 2 ). The pITG cluster seems to be close to or to overlap with the lateral occipital complex (LOC) ( Grill-Spector, et al. 1998 ;  Grill-Spector, et al. 2000 ) and the fusiform gyrus ( Buckner, et al. 1998 ) that shows neural adaptation (i.e., repetition suppression) to object identity. Of note is that the pITG modulation is found only in the left hemisphere. As the left FG (−40 −52 −6) near to pITG (−48 −52 −8) is reported to show semantic adaptation ( Koutstaal, et al. 2001 ), the enhanced activity in the left pITG may indicate a change in the semantic processing of objects. For example, a photograph of a kettle ( Fig 1 ) may activate the semantic memory of either the handle of the kettle or the handle on the lid rather than the kettle as a whole. The reverse contrast (DIFF < SAME) revealed the right lingual gyrus (V1/2) ( Fig 2H  right,  Table 2 ). The main effect of TYPE (as a t contrast for PRE > POW) was found in the left LOC, bilateral dorsal visual stream, and the right basal ganglia ( Fig 2G ,  Table 3 ). The POW > PRE contrast revealed no significant effect. 
 
 
 DCM results 
 The Bayesian model selection procedure was applied for three sessions separately. The three results all indicated that the model that allows all the connections is the best model ( Fig 4 ). The model expected probabilities of the winning model were 6.75, 6.94, and 5.87 × 10 −2  in the session 1 to 3, while those of other 27 models were less than 3.75 × 10 −2 . The model exceedance probabilities of the winning model were 1.30, 1.41, and 1.08 × 10 −1 , while those of other 27 models were less than 4.14 × 10 −2 . The one-sample t-tests on the connection strength revealed all the intrinsic connection strengths are significant ( Fig 4D ,  Table 4 ) except AIP→DLPFC, AIP→V1, and PMv→DLPFC. The same statistical tests on the modulatory effect by GRIP-CHANGE found that DIFFERENT relative to SAME augments the convergenc of the causal influences on the PMv from the AIP, DLPFC, and pITG ( Fig 4E ,  Table 5 ). It also increases the  interaction  between the ventral (pITG) and dorsal (AIP) visual streams. The t-tests on the modulatory effect by TYPE revealed that the power grip, relative to the precision grip, increased the  causal influence  from the AIP to PMv ( Fig 4F ,  Table 6 ). Since our current knowledge of anatomical connectivity of the human brain is limited, the best DCM model may not exclusively be comprised of direct connections. Rather, it suggests the most likely causal influence flow possibly including indirect connections via hidden (i.e., not modeled, such as DLPFC→area 24→F6→F5 (PMv) ( Rizzolatti and Luppino 2001 ) regions. Even after taking the uncertainty in the directness of connections into account, however, we can summarize that the present DCM results imply the interaction of the dorsal and ventral visual streams and the convergence of causal influences on the PMv. 
 
 
 
 Discussion 
 
 Interaction of dorsal and ventral visual streams, and grip selection at the PMv 
 We consider that grip selection involves the PMv, AIP, and pITG, which showed higher activities in the DIFFERENT conditions than in the SAME conditions (i.e., the main effect of GRIP-CHANGE). We attribute the BOLD signal increase to the cost of overriding the previous neural computation in each region. In addition to these changes in the regional signal amplitude, the DCM results further suggest a dynamic change in the network in response to the increased selection demands ( Fig 4E ). Firstly, it increases the bottom-up neural activities in the course of V1→pITG→PMv. This suggests the altered grip may require an update in object recognition, for example from the handle of the kettle to the handle on the lid (see  Fig 1 ). Secondly, the interaction increases between the dorsal (AIP) and the ventral (pITG) visual areas. Computation of affordable hand movements in the dorsal visual pathway may be biased by the attended part (e.g., handle of the kettle or the handle on the lid) of the object. Lastly, the neural information representing the task instruction (DLPFC), possible hand shapes (AIP), and object recognition (pITG) converges on the PMv, where the selection of grip seems to happen. The grip selection may be achieved by the integration of distributed heteromodal information. 
 
 
 Grasping real objects and semantic information retrieval 
 Several lines of research have suggested that grasping does not need recognition of the objects. Lesion studies reported a double dissociation between grasping and object recognition due to occipitotempolal ( Goodale, et al. 1991 ) and parietal ( Jakobson, et al. 1991 ) damage. Neuroimaging techniques also revealed that grasping activates the dorsal visual pathway as opposed to the ventral visual pathway responsible for object recognition ( Culham, et al. 2003 ;  James, et al. 2003 ). However, we often grasp an identified object as the first action of meaningful goal-directed behavior, and it is indeed hard to exclude the involvement of the semantic memory retrieval process from grasping objects of everyday use. For example, one will be surprised if one picks up a book which is extremely heavy or light. This suggests that the plausible weight is retrieved from long-term semantic memory through visual identification of the object in advance of the execution of the grasping/lifting movement ( Gordon, et al. 1993 ). Similarly, how to grasp is also influenced by the knowledge and the goal of action. One will take the handle of a cup after pouring hot coffee into it, but one may grab an empty cup anywhere if one fetches it for washing. The present study suggests interaction between the grip formation and the object recognition: The dorsal (AIP) and the ventral visual streams (pITG) have significant intrinsic connections and there is also a significant task dependent modulation of the connection strength between them, which complements preceding anatomical study ( Borra, et al. 2008 ) . 
 
 
 Asymmetric effects of prior grip type 
 Although we predicted signal increases in regions involved in grip selection when the subjects made a different grip than the first one, POW2diff condition did not show a signal increase. These asymmetric effects between the grip types might be explained by the difference in the computational load between the two grips. The greater activation in POW1 than PRE1 may indicate that POW1 require more computation than PRE1. The higher computational load in power grip may be accounted for by greater degree of freedom in forming the grip hand shape than in the precision grip. For example, more hand muscles must be controlled in power grip. When the first task (POW1) was different and computationally heavier than the second one (PRE2), the neural cost of overriding the previous response may be higher. 
 
 
 Laterality 
 The present study found brain activation predominantly in the left hemisphere. This may be partly explained by the use of the right hand, but clinical observations suggest the significant lateralization of the ability to combine the visual recognition of objects with the associated action. The miming of tool use is selectively disturbed with left brain damage ( Goldenberg, et al. 2003 ), especially in inferior frontal damage patients ( Goldenberg, et al. 2007 ). Furthermore, split-brain patients have difficulty in the pantomiming of object use only when they use their left hands ( Lausberg, et al. 2003 ), suggesting the critical importance of the left hemisphere for this. The leftward lateralized activation is also remarkable in the planning of tool-use gestures even using the left hand ( Johnson-Frey, et al. 2005 ). Thus, converging evidence suggests that the left hemisphere has a dominance in controlled access to semantic memory not only in linguistic but also in motoric domains. 
 
 
 Pantomiming and real movement 
 Although we identified regions that were consistently found in real grasping movement studies such as the PMv, AIP, and pITG, we need to consider the possibility that the use of pantomiming can limit the generalizability to real grasping. Studies on brain-damaged patients have clearly demonstrated the double dissociation between real and pantomimed grasping. Visual form agnosia patients who have lesions in the ventral visual pathway can grasp 3D objects but fail to pantomime the same action ( Goodale, et al. 1994 ;  Goodale, et al. 1991 ). By contrast, patients with lesions to the dorsal visual pathway, as in optic ataxia, fail in real grasping, but perform the same movement better when pantomiming ( Milner, et al. 2001 ). Furthermore, dissociation is also evidenced in the kinematics of the actual and fake grasping movements in brain-damaged patients ( Hermsdorfer, et al. 2006 ;  Laimgruber, et al. 2005 ) and in normals ( Westwood, et al. 2000 ). 
 Motivated by this line of evidence, a fMRI study critically examined if real and pantomimed grasping differed in terms of brain activation ( Kroliczak, et al. 2007 ). This study found that pantomimed grasping activated the same regions at a consistently lower level than real grasping did, but this quantitative relation is reversed in the right temporal region ( Kroliczak, et al. 2007 ). This fMRI finding, together with clinical observations, opens up the possibility that there are different neural mechanisms for real and pantomimed grasping. Therefore, further research is necessary to ascertain if the present findings are generalizable to the neural mechanisms of real grasping movements. 
 Instead, the present study provides information about the neural system dynamics for hand shape formation toward meaningful visual objects. Firstly, we identified the brain network dynamics in response to the increased selection demands. Indeed, the present study replicated the finding of a PMv activation in response to increased selection demands reported in a word generation study ( Thompson-Schill, et al. 1999 ), suggesting a domain-general mechanism in selecting a response from competing candidates. The present study further suggests that the enhanced PMv activation reflects the increased causal influence to the region from posterior regions such as parietal and inferior temporal cortices, as well as from the prefrontal cortex, which specifies the current task. Secondly, the use of daily (i.e., meaningful) objects enabled us to detect the interaction between the dorsal (‘where’) and the ventral (‘what’) visual streams ( Ungerleider and Haxby 1994 ) in the formation of the hand motor response associated with the meanings of the object. Although the present results may not be directly generalizable to real grasping, it suggests general mechanisms in the selection of motor response and an interaction between the dorsal and ventral visual streams in the context of hand shape formation toward meaningful visual objects.

 Examples of the stimuli and the grips 
 The diagram at the bottom represents task blocks. In each block, seven objects are shown with duration of 4 s. Here we show examples of the stimuli (middle row) and the responses (top row). In the first PRE1 condition, an iron kettle and wrench are presented. One or two asterisks are drawn on the pictures to indicate where to put the index finger and the thumb in a precision grip. In PRE2same condition, the same picture (a wrench with two asterisks) is shown again and the subject performs the same miming of grasping. By contrast, the same objects (an iron kettle) is shown in POW2diff condition but with different symbols (a bar), which indicates the part to be grasped with the power grip. The subject is requested to change the grip type in ‘diff’ conditions as opposed to repeating the same grip in ‘same’ conditions.

 Mean VOI signals for the repetition effect. 
 The BOLD signal difference between the first and the second presentation (i.e., BOLD signals in the second presentation minus those in the first). BOLD signal enhancement is found only in the PRE2diff condition, and other conditions show signal suppression. Signals are represented in an arbitrary unit, but common to all VOIs.

 DCM analysis 
 Top: Models. A: Fixed connections throughout all the models. The V1 receives the visual input, while the DLPFC receives the instruction that specifies the grip type. The bidirectional connections PMv-AIP, V1-AIP, and V1-pITG were fixed to exist in all the models. 
 B: The bidirectional connections between DLPFC- AIP, DLPFC- PMv, and DLPFC- pITG were allowed seven variations, namely [p q r]=[1 1 1],[1 1 0],[1 0 1],[0 1 1],[1 0 0],[0 1 0],or[0 0 1], where 0 means no connection is supposed and 1 means bidirectional connection is supposed. 
 C: Similar to B, the bidirectional connection between pITG- AIP and pITG-PMv had four variations, namely [s t]=[1 1],[1 0],[0 1],[0 0]. 
 Combination of A-C makes a total of twenty-eight models. 
 Bottom: The best model in the Baysial model comparison. 
 D. The full connection model was the best model. The one-sample t-tests showed significant connections in all the connections except AIP→DLPFC, AIP→V1, and PMv→DLPFC. Mean and SD of strength estimates and the result of one sample t-test (p value) are given in  Table 4 . 
 E. Significant modulation of the connection strength by the factor GRIP-CHANGE. DIFFERENT grips compared with SAME grips in the second presentation increased the bottom-up ventral visual stream (V1→pITG→PMv) and the interaction of the dorsal (AIP) and ventral (pITG) visiual areas. The prefrontal (DLPFC), the dorsal (AIP) and ventral (pITG) visual signals converge on the PMv, where the grip hand posture may be selected. Mean and SD of strength estimates and the result of the one sample t-test (p value) are given in  Table 5 . 
 F. Significant modulation of the connection strength by the factor TYPE. Power grips had a stronger connection in AIP→PMv compared with precision grips. Mean and SD of strength estimates and the result of the one sample t-test (p value) are given in  Table 6 .

 Note the contrasts between the first and the second presentation (i.e., repetition effect; POW2diff-POW1, POW2same-POW1, PRE2diff-PRE1, and PRE2same-PRE1) were fed into the ANOVA. Interaction was calculated as a t contrast. Height threshold: T=3.28 (p=0.001 uncorrected), and extent threshold k =50 voxels (p=0.053 corrected for cluster level inference). 
 Cer: cerebellum, PMd: dorsal premotor area, pIPS: posterior intra parietal sulcus, IPL: inferior parietal lobule, PMv: ventral premotor area, DLPFC, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, IPL: inferior parietal lobule, pIPS: posterior intra parietal sulcus. 
 The tables were created by selecting up to three maxima in the clusters more than 4.0 mm apart. When more than one maximum was found in the same anatomical region, only the one with the highest t value was shown.
