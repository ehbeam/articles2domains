 In the present study, we sought to examine whether the fronto-striatal
learning system, which has been implicated in bulimia nervosa, would demonstrate
altered BOLD activity during probabilistic category learning in women who met
subthreshold criteria for bulimia nervosa (Sub-BN). Sub-BN, which falls within
the clinical category of Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS), is
comprised of individuals who demonstrate recurrent binge eating, efforts to
minimize their caloric intake and caloric retention, and elevated levels of
concern about shape, weight, and/or eating, but just fail to meet the diagnostic
threshold for bulimia nervosa (BN). fMRI data were collected from eighteen women
with subthreshold-BN (Sub-BN) and nineteen healthy control women group-matched
for age, education and body mass index (MC) during the weather prediction task.
Sub-BN participants demonstrated increased caudate nucleus and dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activation during the learning of probabilistic
categories. Though the two subject groups did not differ in behavioral
performance, over the course of learning, Sub-BN participants showed a dynamic
pattern of brain activity differences when compared to matched control
participants. Regions implicated in episodic memory, including the medial
temporal lobe (MTL), retrosplenial cortex, middle frontal gyrus, and anterior
and posterior cingulate cortex showed decreased activity in the Sub-BN
participants compared to MCs during early learning which was followed by
increased involvement of the DLPFC during later learning. These findings
demonstrate that women with Sub-BN demonstrate differences in fronto-striatal
learning system activity, as well as a distinct functional pattern between
fronto-striatal and MTL learning systems during the course of implicit
probabilistic category learning.

 Introduction 
 At any given time, 10% or more of late adolescent and adult women
report symptoms of eating disorders at a level that is associated with significant
distress and impairment ( Hudson et al.,
2007 ). A recent review has suggested that 50%–75% of
treatment-seeking individuals fit within the category Eating Disorder Not Otherwise
Specified (EDNOS) ( Fairburn and Bohn, 2005 ).
Within the EDNOS category, several subgroups have been identified. Examples of these
subgroups include: subthreshold cases of individuals who just fail to meet the
diagnostic thresholds for anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa (AN or BN),
individuals who have a mixture of features of both AN and BN, and individuals who
experience repeated episodes of binge eating without extreme weight control measures
(termed binge eating disorder). Individuals with EDNOS show elevated levels of
concern about shape, weight, and/or eating which are psychological symptoms of
eating disorders that precipitate, accompany, and maintain behavioral symptoms
( Byrne and McLean, 2002 ,  Fairburn, 2008  and  Hartmann et al., 2009 ). The positive presence of psychological symptoms
is currently required for all EDNOS diagnoses (excluding variants of AN without
over-concern with shape or weight) including subthreshold bulimia nervosa, and the
level of psychological symptoms is considered one indicator of eating disorder
severity ( Byrne and McLean, 2002  and  Hartmann et al., 2009 ). While the EDNOS
category is widely used by clinicians, very little research has been carried out to
characterize these individuals diagnostically, behaviorally, and neurobiologically
( Rockert et al., 2007 ). The current
experiment was conducted to evaluate individuals with subthreshold bulimia nervosa
(Sub-BN) using functional imaging methods. 
 The fronto-striatal system plays an important role in controlling
goal-directed thoughts and behaviors, including response inhibition, reward
processing, and stimulus-response learning ( Alexander
et al., 1990  and  Knowlton et al.,
1996 ; see  Miller and Cohen, 2001 
for review). Changes in fronto-striatal circuitry during self-regulatory control and
reward processing have been reported in individuals with BN ( Marsh et al., 2009a ), as well as in individuals recovered
from AN and BN ( Wagner et al., 2007  and  Wagner et al., 2009 ). Specifically,  Marsh et al. (2009a)  showed BOLD signal
hypoactivation in multiple regions of the frontal-striatal regions among individuals
with BN during a task requiring motivated regulatory control and inhibition of
automatic responses while  Wagner et al., 2007 
and  Wagner et al., 2009  found that women who
had recovered from BN and AN showed hypoactivation in the anterior ventral striatum
in response to correct answers in a guessing-game task. In the present study, we
predicted that individuals with Sub-BN, who endorse the same psychological symptoms
as BN, but do not endorse a diagnostic level of behavioral symptoms, would
demonstrate BOLD activity changes in the fronto-striatal system during probabilistic
category learning. 
 Probabilistic category learning, in particular the weather prediction task
(WPT), is a task that has been commonly used to assess fronto-striatal system
function in healthy individuals ( Aron et al.,
2006 ,  Foerde et al., 2006 ,  Knowlton et al., 1994 ,  Poldrack et al., 1999 ,  Poldrack et al., 2001  and  Poldrack and
Rodriguez, 2004 ), and individuals with neurological ( Moody et al., 2004  and  Shohamy et al., 2004 ) and psychological disorders ( Weickert et al., 2009 ). The pathway within the
fronto-striatal system implicated in implicit incremental or stimulus-response
learning includes the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the dorsal striatum
( Alexander et al., 1990 ), and is often
referred to as the implicit or procedural memory system ( Knowlton et al., 1996  and  Packard and McGaugh, 1996 ). While the fronto-striatal system is integral
to the process of probabilistic category learning ( Knowlton et al., 1996 ), the system’s interactions with the
medial temporal lobe (MTL) mediated memory system ( Squire et al., 1993 ) are also well characterized as being essential in
implicit incremental learning ( Poldrack et al.,
1999 ,  Poldrack et al., 2001  and
 Poldrack and Packard, 2003 ). These
reports suggest parallel activation and suppression of distinct regions during
category learning, including the caudate nucleus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
of the fronto-striatal system and the hippocampal formation within the MTL ( Poldrack et al., 2001 ). Therefore, by utilizing
the WPT, we were able to examine patterns of fronto-striatal fMRI activity in
Sub-BN, along with the well-characterized interactions with the MTL memory system
during probabilistic category learning. Based on previous reports, which propose an
under-utilization of the fronto-striatal regions in AN ( Steinglass and Walsh, 2006 ) and BN ( Marsh et al., 2009b ), we hypothesized that Sub-BN
participants would demonstrate decreased fronto-striatal activity and increased
involvement of the MTL during the WPT. We also hypothesized we would see differences
across time in the recruitment of fronto-striatal and MTL memory systems between
Sub-BN participants and healthy control women. 
 
 
 Methods 
 
 Participants and clinical assessments 
 This study was approved by the Boston University Charles River Campus
Institutional Review Board as well as the Partners Healthcare Human Research
Committee. Participants were recruited from the greater Boston area and
responded to public recruitment materials. Written informed consent was obtained
from all participants prior to enrollment. Eighteen women with clinically
significant symptoms of subthreshold bulimia nervosa (Sub-BN) and nineteen
control women (MC) who were group-matched for age, years of education and body
mass index (BMI) participated ( Table 1 ).
All participants were assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for
DSM-IV (SCID) ( First et al., 2002 ) and
the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) ( Fairburn
et al., 1993 ). The EDE provides positive diagnosis of an eating
disorder on the basis of the behavioral symptoms of objective binge eating
disorder and compensatory behaviors, as well as the attempted restraint of
caloric intake, and over-concern with shape and weight. The EDE provides two
cognitive subscales (over-concern with shape and with weight) and a restraint
subscale reflecting efforts to restrict or restrain eating. The global EDE score
is the mean of these three subscales, and has been widely used as a sensitive
measure of the severity of eating disorder psychological symptoms ( Cooper et al., 1989  and  Fairburn and Cooper, 1993 ). Participants were
excluded on the basis of any previous or current neurological or medical
disease, learning disabilities, or substance abuse, and all MC participants were
free of any current DSM-IV-TR Axis 1 psychiatric disorder and of the use of
psychoactive medication. 
 The criteria for an eating disorder diagnosis of Sub-BN requires the
positive presence of over-concern with weight or shape; recurrent binge-eating
episodes (including loss of control over eating, resulting in the consumption of
an objectively or subjectively large amount of food); and recurrent compensatory
behaviors (i.e., purging by vomiting or laxative/diuretic use, severe caloric
restriction, or driven exercise), at a frequency that falls short (1 binge per
week on average for three months) of that required to diagnose full BN (2 binges
per week on average for three months). The diagnostic criteria for
full-threshold bulimia nervosa specify that you must have an average of 2
objectively large binges per week on average for three months. Our Sub-BN
participants did not meet this frequency criteria for objective binge episodes,
and therefore do not meet the full-criteria for BN. However, when subjective
binge episodes are included, our sample included participants who did have more
than 2 combined subjective and objective binge episodes on average per week.
Sub-BN participants were not excluded for previous or current mood and anxiety
disorders because these conditions are often comorbid with eating disorders
( Godart et al., 2007 ), but were
excluded for current treatment with psychoactive medication. Participants with a
history of significantly low body weight (< 85% ideal body weight) or
past or current diagnosis of anorexia nervosa were also excluded. 
 Severity of eating disorder (ED) symptoms was measured using subscale
scores from the Eating Disorder Exam/Examination (EDE) and was corroborated by
scores on self-report questionnaires [Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26)
( Garner et al., 1982 ), Eating
Disorder Inventory (EDI-2) ( Garner,
1991 )]. All participants also completed the Beck Depression
Inventory (BDI-II) ( Beck, 1997 ). A brief
neuropsychological test battery was also conducted to ensure accurate cognitive
characterization of the two groups. The focus of the neuropsychological testing
was to assess fronto-striatal function on tasks of executive function
[Wisconsin card sorting test, Go/No-Go, Trail Making Tests A and B,
Stroop color-word test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)-III
letter-number sequencing], as well as control for normal explicit
learning and memory function (Rey auditory verbal learning test), attention and
concentration (WAIS-III Digit span) and general cognitive ability (American
National Adult Reading Test, WAIS-III matrix reasoning). 
 
 
 Weather prediction task (WPT) 
 Fig. 1  illustrates the WPT
probabilistic category learning paradigm. In the WPT, participants gradually
learn cue-outcome associations based on feedback which is probabilistically
determined. The task design and timings utilized in the current task were based
on studies from  Poldrack et al., 2001  and
 Foerde et al., 2008 . Before entering
the scanner, participants were instructed to try and learn which cards predicted
sunshine and which predicted rain, and then practiced 17 weather prediction and
perceptual-motor baseline trials on novel stimuli not seen during the actual
scanning run. During the prediction blocks, subjects were asked to decide which
of two outcomes (rainy or sunny weather) would occur on the basis of a set of
one, two, or three cues (out of four possible cues). The stimuli consisted of
four tarot cards, each with different shapes (circle, square, triangle,
diamond). Each of the four cues was independently associated to an outcome with
a fixed probability, and the two outcomes (rain or sunshine) occurred equally as
often. The probabilities for each cue combination followed those used by  Knowlton et al. (1994)  (For full
probability structure, see  Supplemental Table 1 ). The actual weather outcome and response
feedback was given after each prediction was made (correct: green check marks;
incorrect: red X’s). During the perceptual-motor baseline task,
participants were instructed to respond each time a set of three baseline cards
was presented on the screen ( Poldrack et al.,
2001 ). All stimuli presented in prediction and perceptual-motor
baseline blocks were presented for 3000 ms, and feedback was displayed for 1000
ms. Prediction blocks lasted for a total of 76.5 s (17 trials) or 72 s (16
trials) and the perceptual-motor blocks lasted for a total of 76.5 s (17
trials). Prediction and perceptual-motor blocks were counterbalanced across the
entire study. 
 Accuracy of behavioral performance on individual trials was defined as a
response that predicts the outcome most strongly associated with the set of
cards presented, instead of the individual trial feedback. In this way, accuracy
represents the ability to average the strength of each cue over a number of
trials. 
 
 
 WPT post-scan tests 
 Following scanning, participants were given a single cue estimation and
a cue selection test to assess knowledge acquired about the relationship between
the four cues and the weather outcome ( Gluck et
al., 2002 ). Subjects were first shown each of the four cue cards one
at a time and asked to choose one of four possible percentage outcomes:
20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%. Participants were then
shown all four cues and asked, “What if you knew it was going to be
rainy and one card was showing, which card would it be?” The same
question was also asked for the sunny weather outcome. 
 
 
 Neuroimaging 
 Scanning took place at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging on a
3-Tesla Siemens MAGNETOM TrioTim MRI system using a whole-head 12-channel coil.
High-resolution T1-weighted (MP-RAGE) structural scans were acquired for
anatomical localization (GRAPPA; TR = 2,530 ms; TE = 3.44 ms;
flip angle = 7°; slices = 176; field of view =
256; resolution = 1 mm × 1 mm × 1 mm). Acquisition of
the functional images employed an echoplanar T2*-weighted gradient echo
sequence (32 axial slices aligned along the anterior and posterior commissure
line, slice thickness = 4.5 mm, TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30
ms, flip angle = 90°, 64 × 64, 4.5 mm3 voxels). 
 
 
 WPT behavioral data analysis 
 Percentage correct and reaction times were defined as the dependent
measures of learning in the WPT. Both percentage correct and reaction times were
aggregated in quartiles representing 50 WPT trials in order to better assess the
temporal pattern of learning ( Fera et al.,
2005 ). Mixed factor repeated measures ANOVAs with within participant
factors of quartile, as well as percentage correct or reaction times and a
between-participant factor of group were implemented. The main effect of
quartile for both percentage correct and reaction time were examined to
determine learning of cue-outcome contingencies throughout the experiment. 
 We used independent sample t-tests of the percentage correct of
post-scan estimation of single cue outcomes for both rain and sunshine to assess
between-group differences in the outcome associations learned in the WPT. For
the cue selection post-scan tests, group differences in flexible identification
of the single cue most highly associated with both the rain and sunshine
outcomes were assessed using independent 2 × 2 (MC/Sub-BN,
correct/incorrect) X2 analyses. 
 
 
 fMRI preprocessing and modeling 
 fMRI data were preprocessed using Statistical Parametric Mapping
software (SPM8; Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK) under
the assumption of the general linear model. fMRI images were reoriented so the
origin (i.e., coordinate xyz = [0 0 0]) was at the
anterior commissure. Images were realigned with respect to the first scan in the
fMRI time-series using INRIAlign ( Freire et al.,
2002 ), a motion correction algorithm unbiased by local BOLD signal
changes. The high-resolution structural images were then coregistered to the
mean fMRI image created during the motion correction step and segmented into
white and gray matter images. Normalization of structural and fMRI images into
standard Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) space was performed using the
Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra (DARTEL)
toolbox included with SPM8 and resampled to 2 mm isotropic voxels. The
normalized structural images of all 37 participants were averaged after
normalization for displaying overlays of functional results. All functional
images were spatially smoothed using a 6 mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian
filter. 
 Design matrices for the WPT were modeled using a boxcar function
convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function. Several sources of
variance were controlled for by regression of nuisance variables by following
the procedure described in  Buckner et al.
(2009) . These nuisance variables included: six parameter rigid body
head motion (obtained from motion correction), the BOLD signal averaged over the
whole-brain [correlates with respiration-induced fMRI signal
fluctuations ( Birn et al., 2006  and  Wise et al., 2004 )], the BOLD
signal averaged over regions centered bilaterally in the lateral ventricles, and
bilateral regions centered in the deep cerebral white matter. Temporally shifted
versions of these waveforms were also removed by inclusion of the first temporal
derivatives in the linear model. To assess category learning related BOLD
activation, linear contrasts of the prediction blocks relative to
perceptual-motor baseline blocks were created at the individual participant
level. To better evaluate the temporal dynamics of learning-related BOLD
changes, the prediction blocks were aggregated into quartiles of 50 trials. 
 
 
 Within- and between-group patterns of category learning related BOLD
activity 
 A region of interest (ROI) based SPM full factorial ANOVA with factors
of group, condition, and quartile was conducted to assess group level
differences in category learning related BOLD activity (prediction >
perceptual-motor baseline). Individual participant weather prediction vs.
perceptual-motor baseline contrasts were used as the condition factors in order
to account for within-participant variance. The main effect of condition
examined differential category learning related BOLD activity across
participants within our ROIs. Regional differences in category learning related
BOLD activity between the Sub-BN and MC participants were examined by the
interaction between group and condition within our ROIs and regional differences
in category learning related BOLD activity that varied across time were examined
by the interaction between group, condition and quartile. Caudate, putamen,
hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, anterior cingulate, precuneus and prefrontal
cortex (including dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and middle
frontal gyrus) served as anatomical ROIs and were derived as masks from the AAL
ROI library; a standard set of anatomical definitions defined by hand on a
single brain which matched the MNI/ICBM templates ( Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002 ). 
 Post-hoc ROI-based one-sample and two-sample t-tests, as well as percent
BOLD signal change extractions using peaks of regional activation identified
within the group level main effect and interaction contrasts of the omnibus
ANOVA were employed to determine the directionality of within-group fMRI
activity (activation vs. deactivation), as well as between-group fMRI activity
differences (increases vs. decreases). Percent BOLD signal change was extracted
from each individual participant utilizing the MarsBar region of interest
toolbox for SPM8 ( Brett et al., 2002 ). For
anatomical ROIs with more than one significant peak, only the most significant
peak (Z-score) was subjected to post-hoc analyses. All peaks were surrounded by
spheres of 5 mm. Only non-zero voxels within the anatomical mask and sphere for
each participant were examined. Additional post-hoc ANOVAs were performed in
PASW 18 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago IL.). 
 On all factorial ANOVA and one-sample t-test statistical parametric maps
(SPMs), an individual voxel threshold of p = 0.01 was used which was
corrected for multiple comparisons at the cluster level of p = 0.05
using 57 contiguous resampled voxels. The cluster extent threshold was obtained
by simulating whole-brain fMRI activation using custom software written in
MATLAB ( Slotnick et al., 2003 ). By
modeling the functional image matrix (64 × 64 × 32 voxels),
assuming a type I error voxel activation probability of 0.01, and smoothing the
activation map by convolution with a 3-dimensional 6-mm FWHM Gaussian kernel,
the size of each contiguous cluster of voxels was determined using Monte Carlo
statistics. The probability of each cluster size was determined by 10,000
simulations and the cluster extent that yielded p < 0.05 was selected for use
for the voxel extent thresholding. All between-group SPMs were corrected at an
individual voxel threshold of p = 0.05 corrected for multiple
comparisons at the cluster level of p = 0.05 using 103 contiguous
resampled voxels. 
 
 
 Correlations of category learning related BOLD activity and level of
depression 
 To determine if a relationship existed between depression and the brain
regions identified in the main effect of category learning and group ×
category learning analyses, correlations with BDI-II score and percent signal
change were run for each brain region identified in  Table 2  across all participants (n = 37).
Category learning fMRI activity was calculated by taking the difference between
prediction and perceptual-motor baseline percent BOLD signal change extractions.
Correlations were corrected for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni). 
 
 
 
 Results 
 
 Participant characterization 
 Data are reported from eighteen women with clinically significant
symptoms of subthreshold bulimia nervosa (Sub-BN) and nineteen control women
(MC) who were group-matched for age, years of education, and BMI (see  Table 1 ). Self-reported history of eating
disorder symptoms ranged from 1 to 8 years (mean = 4.1 ± 2.0
years). 
 Eating disorder symptoms were comparable in severity to those observed
among other eating-disorder samples. For each of the 3 months prior to study
participation, Sub-BN participants reported 7.73 (± 7.72) objective and
4.75 (± 5.53) subjective binge episodes, 8.41 (± 6.37) purging
episodes, and 12.33 (± 11.20) non-purging compensatory behaviors on
average per month (assessed as 28 days on the Eating Disorder Examination).
Non-purging compensatory behaviors included extreme restriction (< 1200
calories per day), driven exercise, and diet pill use. Average EDE subscale
scores for the Sub-BN participants (see  Table
1 ) did not significantly differ (p > 0.1 in all cases) from the
published normative data for bulimia nervosa (based on comparison to norms
published in  Fairburn and Cooper, 1993 ).
All Sub-BN participants reported stable and consistent menstrual cycles for each
of the 3 months prior to the study. Sub-BN participants scored significantly
higher than MC participants on the BDI-II ( Beck,
1997 ) [t(34) = −6.648, p < 0.0001; see
 Table 1 ]. 
 There were no significant group differences on any cognitive functions
assessed by the neuropsychological test battery (see  Supplemental Table 2 ). 
 
 
 WPT behavioral performance 
 The mixed factor repeated measures ANOVA of accuracy scores revealed a
main effect of quartile [F(3,102) = 5.360, p <
0.002], which demonstrated a significant linear trend [F(1,35)
= 6.669, p < 0.014], suggesting improved performance in both
groups across quartiles during the WPT. A mixed factor repeated measures ANOVA
of reaction times revealed a main effect of quartile [F(3,102) =
15.734, p < 0.0001] which also demonstrated a significant linear
trend over quartile [F(1,35) = 23.402, p < 0.0001]
( Fig. 2 ). 
 
 
 Post-scan tests 
 Results from the single-cue estimation test revealed that the
information learned during the WPT did not differ between Sub-BN and MC
participants. Across both Sub-BN and MC groups, the ability to select the cue
cards most highly associated with rain and sunshine outcomes did not differ
between groups for both outcomes. In addition, the number of participants within
each group who correctly predicted both outcomes did not differ between
groups. 
 
 
 ROI-based SPM factorial ANOVA 
 The ROI-based SPM factorial ANOVA revealed regional main effects of
category learning related BOLD activity (prediction > perceptual-motor
baseline), group × category learning related BOLD interactions, and
group × category learning × quartile interactions. In addition,
no regional main effect of group was identified suggesting that over time,
within-participant category learning related BOLD activity did not consistently
differ within our ROIs. 
 
 
 Main effect of category learning 
 Consistent with previous studies ( Fera
et al., 2005 ,  Poldrack et al.,
1999 ,  Poldrack et al., 2001 
and  Weickert et al., 2009 ), the spatial
distribution of the BOLD signal involved the bilateral caudate nucleus, left
hippocampus, bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [DLPFC;
Brodmann’s area (BA) 9 and 46], and middle frontal gyrus (BA 8
and 10), anterior and posterior cingulate cortex (BA 32 and 30) and precuneus
(BA 7) ( Fig. 3 ;  Table 2 ). Post-hoc one-sample t-tests confirm the
participation of these regions within each group ( Fig 4a ) ( Supplemental Table 3 ) and reveal that both groups demonstrated
increased category learning related BOLD activity within bilateral caudate
nucleus and putamen, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex (BA 32),
dorsolateral PFC (BA 9 and 46) and precuneus (BA 7). Increases in category
learning related suppression of BOLD signal were found in both Sub-BN and MC
groups in bilateral MFG (BA 8 and 10) and left posterior cingulate cortex ( Supplemental Table 3 ).
These results confirm the presence of category learning related BOLD signal
within a priori regions of interest across groups that are consistent with
previous reports of category learning related patterns of BOLD signal activation
and suppression ( Poldrack et al., 1999 
and  Poldrack et al., 2001 ). 
 
 
 Group × category learning interactions 
 The ROI-based SPM full factorial ANOVA also identified a significant
group × category learning related interaction spanning bilateral DLPFC
and VLPFC (BA 9 and 44, respectively) and anterior cingulate cortex (BA 32), as
well as right MFG (BA 6), and left precuneus (BA 7) ( Fig. 3b ) ( Table
2 ). Post-hoc two-sample t-tests revealed that collapsed across
quartiles, the Sub-BN participants demonstrated greater increases in category
learning related BOLD activity in the right caudate nucleus [Z score
= 3.68; k = 126; peak = 14 0 14], bilateral
DLPFC (BA 9 and 46) [right: Z score = 3.45; k = 822;
peak = 34 32 22 and Z score = 2.58; k = 136; peak
= 44 34 6; left: Z score = 3.40; k = 814; peak =
−30 28 42], right precuneus [Z score = 3.33; k
= 1070; peak = 4 −40 58], right anterior
cingulate cortex [Z score = 2.66; k = 579; peak
= 6 40 24], and left putamen [Z score = 2.40; k
= 155; peak = −32 0 4] compared to MC
participants ( Fig. 4b ). The MC participants
did not demonstrate any significant areas of increased category learning related
BOLD activity collapsed across quartiles. 
 Percent BOLD signal change extractions revealed that the Sub-BN
participants show greater increases in category learning related BOLD activity
in right caudate nucleus and bilateral DLPFC (BA 9 and 46) compared to the MC
group ( Fig. 4b ). While the Sub-BN
participants activated the left DLPFC, MC participants demonstrated inhibition
of BOLD activity in this region ( Fig. 4b ).
Sub-BN participants also demonstrated greater category learning related BOLD
activity in the right anterior cingulate cortex, represented as decreased
suppression of BOLD activity, or less net suppression ( Devor et al., 2007  and  Shmuel et al., 2006 ) during category learning
compared to the perceptual-motor baseline ( Fig.
4b ). MC participants demonstrated greater inhibition of category
learning related BOLD activity in the right precuneus suggesting greater
suppression of this region during category learning (prediction >
perceptual-motor baseline) in MCs ( Fig.
4b ). These results demonstrate greater category learning related BOLD
activity in the caudate nucleus and DLPFC, in addition to reduced suppression of
anterior cingulate cortex and precuneus category learning related BOLD activity
in Sub-BN participants compared to the MC group. 
 
 
 Group × category learning × quartile interactions 
 The ROI-based SPM full factorial ANOVA also identified a significant
group × category learning × quartile interaction within the left
posterior cingulate, hippocampus, MFG (BA 10), and anterior cingulate cortex (BA
24) ( Fig. 3c ) ( Table 2 ), suggesting that category learning related
BOLD signal changes over time differ between groups in these regions. Post-hoc
two sample t-tests demonstrate that over time, the MC participants show greater
early (quartiles 1 and 2) category learning related BOLD signal contributions
within bilateral hippocampus, bilateral anterior cingulate cortex, left MFG (BA
10), left retrosplenial cortex, and right precuneus (BA 7) ( Fig. 5a ) ( Table
3 ). Sub-BN participants demonstrate greater late category learning
related BOLD signal contributions within the right VLPFC (area 45), bilateral
DLPFC (BA 9), bilateral anterior cingulate (BA 32), and bilateral precuneus (BA
7) ( Fig. 5a ) ( Table 3 ). These results suggest disparate patterns
of regional cortical and hippocampal utilization between Sub-BN and MC
participants. MC participants demonstrate increased regional cortical and
hippocampal BOLD signal contributions early in category learning (prediction
> perceptual-motor baseline) while Sub-BN participants demonstrate increased
cortical BOLD signal contributions later in category learning. 
 Percent BOLD signal change extractions from the left posterior cingulate
cortex (BA 23), hippocampus, MFG (BA 10), and anterior cingulate cortex (BA 24)
identified in the group × category learning × quartile
interaction were subsequently entered into an additional post-hoc ANOVA, with
factors of region, quartile and group, to determine the pattern of the category
learning related BOLD signal over time. A significant group × quartile
interaction was revealed [F(3,105) = 7.805; p =
0.0001], but no group × quartile × region interaction
was found suggesting the pattern of category learning between groups was similar
across ROIs.  Fig. 5b  shows that while the
MC participants demonstrated a linear decrease in category learning related BOLD
signal contribution from the left posterior cingulate, hippocampus, MFG, and
anterior cingulate cortex, the Sub-BN participants demonstrated a different
pattern with later increases in category learning related BOLD signal within
these ROIs. 
 
 
 Correlations of category learning related activity and level of
depression 
 Across both MC and Sub-BN participants, correlation analyses between
category learning related percent BOLD signal change extractions and level of
depression, measured with the BDI-II, revealed no significant correlations when
corrected for multiple comparisons. Prior to correction for multiple
comparisons, the left precuneus [peak = −0 −40
58; r(35) = 0.394; p (uncorrected) = 0.016] was the only
region that demonstrated a significant correlation with level of depression. 
 
 
 
 Discussion 
 Despite performing similarly during probabilistic category learning, women
with subthreshold bulimia nervosa (Sub-BN) generated overall increases in BOLD
signal activity in regions of the fronto-striatal learning system compared to
healthy control women (MC). The Sub-BN participants demonstrated increased overall
category learning related activity in the right caudate nucleus and bilateral
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and decreased suppression of the category
learning related BOLD signal in the anterior cingulate cortex. The direction of the
BOLD signal changes within the fronto-striatal system differs from our initial
hypothesis, which was based on an earlier neuroimaging study of individuals with BN
( Marsh et al., 2009b ). The Marsh et al.
study demonstrated hypoactivity of the fronto-striatal system in individuals with BN
during a self-regulatory control task ( Marsh et al.,
2009b ). The pattern of hypoactivity observed in BN participants from
 Marsh et al. (2009b)  was interpreted
specifically in light of findings indicating that individuals with BN are impulsive.
In contrast, our results demonstrate hyperactivity of the fronto-striatal system
during an implicit learning task. Our findings suggest a different but not
contradictory pattern. While both studies suggest inefficiency of the
fronto-striatal system in individuals with BN, it may be that different task demands
will result in different patterns of hypo or hyperactivity within the system. A
similar difference has been noted using the weather prediction and serial reaction
time tasks in healthy individuals ( Poldrack et al.,
2001  and  Schendan et al.,
2003 ). 
 It is also important to point out that these changes in BOLD signal in the
Sub-BN participants occurred in the absence of a difference in behavioral
performance between groups. In neuroimaging studies of patient groups,
hyperactivation in the absence of behavioral differences has been conceptualized in
the fMRI literature to reflect changes related to brain compensation or brain
efficiency (which includes both cognitive and pathological determinants of
efficiency), although these two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive ( Tinaz et al., 2008 ). Distinction between the
two concepts is drawn by the nature of the regional involvement, in that,
compensatory brain processing would be reflected by activity in areas not normally
found to be task-related ( Rauch et al.,
2007 ), and less efficient brain processing would be reflected by
hyperactivation within the normal task-related network ( Tinaz et al., 2008 ). In our Sub-BN subjects,
hyperactivation within the fronto-striatal network may reflect that this system is
working inefficiently, a finding that is consistent with other studies of BN ( Marsh et al., 2009b  and  Wagner et al., 2009 ). 
 Differences in temporal patterns of BOLD activity between the
fronto-striatal and the medial temporal lobe (MTL) memory systems were also found.
Sub-BN participants demonstrated increased suppression during early category
learning (prediction > perceptual-motor baseline) in regions that comprise the
MTL memory system, including the hippocampus, retrosplenial cortex, and middle
frontal gyrus (BA 10), in addition to increased late contributions to category
learning in the anterior cingulate, precuneus (BA 7), ventrolateral prefrontal
cortex (VLPFC; BA 45), and DLPFC (BA 9). Probabilistic category learning initially
requires the involvement of flexible and fast learning dependent on the MTL memory
system, which then, after sufficient learning has taken place, transfers to the
striatal-mediated implicit memory system ( Packard
and McGaugh, 1996 ,  Poldrack et al.,
2001  and  Yin and Knowlton, 2006 ).
Consistent with category learning research in healthy young adults ( Poldrack et al., 1999  and  Poldrack et al., 2001 ), the control (MC) participants demonstrated this
pattern, represented by initial decreased suppression in the hippocampus,
retrosplenial cortex, middle frontal gyrus, and anterior and posterior cingulate,
which was gradually more suppressed over the course of learning. Sub-BN
participants, however, demonstrated initial increases in MTL memory system
suppression which were gradually less suppressed over time and overall increases in
right caudate and bilateral DLPFC. These findings suggest a distinct pattern of MTL
and fronto-striatal memory system utilization; such that Sub-BN participants appear
to preferentially engage the fronto-striatal system during implicit probabilistic
category learning. 
 In addition to their eating disorder symptoms, the Sub-BN participants in
our study also demonstrated significantly elevated levels of depression compared to
MC participants. Both lifetime and current prevalence of mood disorders is common in
eating disorders, and lifetime prevalence estimates range from 30% to
50% in community samples of BN and subthreshold or partial syndrome BN
( Godart et al., 2007 ). By correlating
level of depression with our ROI data, we demonstrated that level of depression did
not influence our fronto-striatal and MTL findings. Interestingly, prior to
correcting for multiple comparisons, the left precuneus demonstrated a significant
positive correlation with level of depression, a region of the posterior medial
cortex that has been implicated in depression and associated with difficulty
disengaging from self-reflection( Johnson et al.,
2009 ). It should also be noted that stage of menstrual cycle and feeding
status prior to fMRI scanning were not controlled; therefore, future studies are
needed to delineate the contribution of potential caloric deprivation, which can
lead to metabolic, neuroendocrine and volumetric differences, to these findings. 
 
 
 Conclusions 
 The current results demonstrate changes in the processing efficiency of the
fronto-striatal system in women with Sub-BN. The results further our understanding
of subthreshold bulimia nervosa by demonstrating that individuals with Sub-BN
display distinct patterns of functional activity in the fronto-striatal system
during probabilistic category learning in the absence of differences in behavioral
performance. The reduced efficiency of the fronto-striatal system may also
contribute to the presence of psychological symptoms of eating disorders (elevated
levels of concern about shape, weight, and/or eating) that precipitate, accompany,
and maintain behavioral symptoms.

 Schematic representation of the weather prediction task experimental paradigm.
The left panels represent prediction trials while the right panels represent
perceptual-motor trials. Participants completed two runs of six weather
prediction blocks (prediction; 100 trials per run) and three perceptual-motor
baseline blocks (perceptual-motor; 51 trials per run), for a total of 200
prediction trials and 102 perceptual-motor trials. Cue cards were presented for
a total of 3000 ms. There were four possible cue-outcome association strengths:
75%, 57%, 43%, or 25%. Feedback was presented
for 1000 ms. Participants were made aware of their progress by showing them
their scores during the rest period following weather prediction blocks. The
score was initially set at 600 and increased by one unit for each correct
response and decreased by one unit for each incorrect response.

 WPT behavioral performance. (a) A trend (p = 0.089) toward between-group
differences in accuracy may suggest a potential delay in habit acquisition in
subthreshold bulimia nervosa (Sub-BN) participants compared to healthy control
women (MC) which occurs in quartile 3. (b) Reaction time performance measures
revealed no between-group differences. Main effect of quartile for reaction time
demonstrated a significant linear trend. 
 
 
 
 
 Fig. 3 
 
 ROI-based SPM factorial ANOVA. SPMs demonstrate significant differences in
category learning related BOLD activity (prediction > perceptual-motor
baseline) across groups in anatomical regions of interest. Slices are overlaid
on the group-averaged anatomical map. (a) Regions demonstrating significant
category learning related BOLD activity in both subthreshold bulimia nervosa
(Sub-BN) and matched healthy control (MC) groups. (b) Regions demonstrating
significant category learning related BOLD activity by group interactions. (c)
Left posterior cingulate, MTL, MFG (BA 10), and anterior cingulate cortex (BA
24) demonstrate significant category learning related BOLD activity by group by
quartile interactions. All SPMs corrected for multiple comparisons to p <
0.05. 
 
 
 
 
 Fig. 4 
 
 Post-hoc contrasts for main effect of category learning related BOLD activity and
category learning related BOLD activity × group interaction. Slices are
overlaid on the group-averaged anatomical map. (a) Regions showing significantly
different category learning related BOLD activity across all participants when
compared to the control task. Regions where category learning related BOLD
activity showed greater BOLD signal compared to the control task in both groups
are shown in red while regions in blue show greater decreases in fMRI BOLD
signal during category learning (prediction > perceptual-motor baseline)
compared to the control task. (b) Regions where Sub-BN participants demonstrate
greater category learning related BOLD activity. Bar graphs represent percent
signal change and are included to demonstrate directionality of fMRI activity
differences. Sub-BN participants revealed greater category learning related BOLD
activity in the caudate nucleus, bilateral dorsolateral PFC and anterior
cingulate cortex. Additionally, Sub-BN participants showed category learning
related specific reductions in fMRI BOLD signal in precuneus when compared to MC
participants.

 Group × category learning × quartile interactions. (a) Post-hoc
random effects two sample t-tests demonstrate significant fMRI BOLD category
learning related activity within anatomical regions of interest within each
quartile. Slices are overlaid on the group-averaged anatomical map. ROIs where
women with subthreshold bulimia nervosa (Sub-BN) demonstrated greater category
learning related BOLD activity compared to healthy control women (MC) over time
is represented by the red color scale (Sub-BN increased activity) and ROIs where
the MC group demonstrated greater category learning related BOLD activity
compared to the Sub-BN group over time is represented by the blue color scale
(Sub-BN decreased activity). (b) Line graph illustrates significant group
× quartile interaction revealed by post-hoc repeated measures ANOVA
utilizing percent signal change extractions from regions demonstrating
significant group × category learning × quartile effects. While
MC participants demonstrate a linear decrease in category learning related BOLD
activity within the left posterior cingulate cortex, MTL, middle frontal gyrus
(BA 10), and anterior cingulate cortex (BA 24), the Sub-BN participants
demonstrate a dysregulated pattern with late increases in category learning
related BOLD activity.

 Research Highlights 
 
 
 
 fMRI study of fronto-striatal learning system in eating disorder
behaviors. 
 
 
 Participants characterized as subthreshold bulimia (Sub-BN) category
of EDNOS. 
 
 
 Sub-BNs did not vary behaviorally from controls on probabilistic
category learning. 
 
 
 Sub- BNs showed increases in caudate nucleus and dorsolated
prefrontal cortex. 
 
 
 Sub-BNs showed distinct temporal pattern of fronto-striatal and MTL
systems.
