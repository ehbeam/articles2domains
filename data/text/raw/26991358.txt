 Working memory is central to the execution of many daily functions and is typically divided into three phases: encoding, maintenance, and retrieval. While working memory performance has been repeatedly shown to decline with age, less is known regarding the underlying neural processes. We examined age-related differences in the neural dynamics that serve working memory by recording high-density magnetoencephalography (MEG) in younger and older adults while they performed a modified, high-load Sternberg working memory task with letters as stimuli. MEG data were evaluated in the time-frequency domain and significant oscillatory responses were imaged using a beamformer. A hierarchical regression was performed to investigate whether age moderated the relationship between oscillatory activity and accuracy on the working memory task. Our results indicated that the spatiotemporal dynamics of oscillatory activity in language-related areas of the left fronto-temporal cortices were similar across groups. Age-related differences emerged during early encoding in the right-hemispheric homologue of Wernicke’s area. Slightly later, group differences emerged in the homologue of Broca’s area and these persisted throughout memory maintenance. Additionally, occipital alpha activity during maintenance was stronger, occurred earlier, and involved more cortical tissue in older adults. Finally, age significantly moderated the relationship between accuracy and neural activity in the prefrontal cortices. In younger adults, as prefrontal activity decreased, accuracy tended to increase. Our results are consistent with predictions of the compensation-related utilization of neural circuits hypothesis (CRUNCH). Such differences in the oscillatory dynamics could reflect compensatory mechanisms, which would aid working memory performance in older age.

 Introduction 
 Working memory refers to the on-line temporary storage and manipulation of information to be employed in ongoing processing, and is central to the execution of a variety of daily functions. It is typically broken down into three phases: encoding, maintenance, and retrieval. Encoding refers to the loading of internal and external information into memory, while maintenance is the process whereby this information is actively retained and rehearsed. Retrieval reflects the active recall and use of this information towards the performance of a specific cognitive activity. Working memory processing has been linked to activations in many neuroanatomical locations, including fronto-parietal networks, occipital cortices, and the cerebellum ( Cabeza and Nyberg, 2000 ;  Rottschy, et al., 2012 ). These neuroanatomical regions can be segregated into those that are associated with specific working memory paradigms (e.g., n-back, Sternberg), specific types of stimuli (e.g., visual, acoustic), and/or specific phases of working memory (e.g., encoding). There are also a number of studies that evaluate activation during overall performance, without distinguishing phases such as encoding and maintenance, and other studies that have utilized oscillatory analyses to examine activity in different frequency bands during working memory processing. Given this, there is some variability in the literature regarding the brain regions that are critical for working memory ( Rottschy, et al., 2012 ). 
 Recent magnetoencephalography (MEG) work has shown increased theta activity in midline frontal regions, with concomitant decreases in high-beta/low-gamma activity during performance of both N-back and Sternberg tasks ( Brookes, et al., 2011 ). This beta/gamma decrease was additionally observed in left fronto-temporal cortices, but only during the Sternberg task. Another MEG study also reported increased frontal theta activity at the sensor level during a Sternberg task ( Jensen and Tesche, 2002 ). Unfortunately, these studies were unable to clearly distinguish whether the oscillatory responses reflected encoding or maintenance operations, as both sequentially presented stimuli, which causes encoding and maintenance operations to occur in parallel. However, a recent MEG investigation used a modified Sternberg task that involved simultaneously presenting the encoding set within a visual array ( Heinrichs-Graham and Wilson, 2015 ), thereby permitting analytical distinction between the three phases of working memory. They found strong decreases in alpha/beta activity in left fronto-temporal cortices during encoding and maintenance operations. This study also reported strong alpha/beta decreases in bilateral occipital cortices beginning immediately after onset of the encoding array, which rapidly dispelled during early maintenance and transformed into a strong increase in a narrower alpha band ( Heinrichs-Graham and Wilson, 2015 ). These results corroborate other studies that have reported increases in parieto-occipital alpha activity during working memory maintenance ( Bonnefond and Jensen, 2012 ;  Bonnefond and Jensen, 2013 ;  Jensen, et al., 2002 ;  Jiang, et al., 2015 ;  Tuladhar, et al., 2007 ). 
 The aforementioned studies all investigated healthy young adults in their analyses and far less is known about working memory networks in older participants. Such studies are of major interest, as working memory performance has been shown to decline with age ( Park, et al., 2002 ;  Salthouse, et al., 1991 ). Several neuroimaging studies, typically utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or positron emission tomography (PET), have addressed this topic and generally reported age-related differences in prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation ( Grady, 2012 ;  Spreng, et al., 2010 ). However, some studies reported stronger and/or greater volumes of activation in older relative to younger adults ( Emery, et al., 2008 ;  Fakhri, et al., 2012 ;  Reuter-Lorenz, et al., 2000 ), whereas others reported the opposite pattern ( Cabeza, et al., 1997 ;  Rypma and D’Esposito, 2000 ). Several studies have also found a combination of hyper-activation and hypo-activation, depending on the brain region, in older relative to younger adults, that varied with memory load ( Cappell, et al., 2010 ;  Mattay, et al., 2006 ). There are also studies that have connected behavioral parameters to age-specific response patterns ( Rypma, et al., 2007 ), and at least one study found increased activation in older relative to younger adults in some areas of the PFC, but a reverse pattern in other areas of the PFC ( Spreng, et al., 2010 ). Beyond the PFC, increased left cerebellar and bilateral occipital activations have been reported in older relative to younger adults during working memory maintenance ( Bennett, et al., 2013 ). Finally, several electrophysiological studies of aging have been conducted. One study demonstrated increased activity in younger relative to older adults in posterior frontal regions ( Solesio-Jofre, et al., 2011 ), whereas another reported greater alpha activity in right temporal electrodes, decreased theta activity in posterior electrodes, and increased low-beta activity in central electrodes of older relative to younger participants ( Karrasch, et al., 2004 ). Of note, one study used MEG and time-domain analyses ( Solesio-Jofre, et al., 2011 ), whereas the other used EEG and an oscillatory approach ( Karrasch, et al., 2004 ); thus, direct comparison of these studies is difficult. 
 In the current study, we examined age-related differences in the neural dynamics of working memory processing using spatially-resolved MEG. As stated above, it is widely known that working memory performance declines with age ( Park, et al., 2002 ;  Salthouse, et al., 1991 ), but the mechanisms involved remain less understood. Furthermore, of the handful of neuroimaging studies available, none have evaluated the temporal dynamics of activity within the encoding and maintenance phases of working memory. Thus, in this study, we used the temporal precision of MEG to identify the neural oscillatory dynamics of working memory performance in younger and older adults, by imaging a sequential series of non-overlapping time bins that spanned the encoding and maintenance phases. Our primary hypotheses were that older participants would exhibit greater oscillatory activity relative to younger participants during encoding and throughout maintenance. Specifically, we expected older adults to engage bilateral PFC and parieto-occipital cortices more strongly during these time windows compared to younger adults. Additionally, we hypothesized that age would moderate the relationship between oscillatory activity and behavioral working memory performance. 
 
 
 Methods and Materials 
 
 Subject Selection 
 We studied 15 older (mean age: 60.2 years-old, SD: 8.2, range: 50–75) and 16 younger (mean age: 26.0 years-old, SD: 2.5, range: 19–30) males. All participants were healthy, Caucasian, and recruited from the local community. Exclusionary criteria included any medical illness affecting CNS function, neurological or psychiatric disorder, history of head trauma, current substance abuse, and the MEG Laboratory’s standard exclusion criteria (e.g., dental braces, metal implants, battery operated implants, and/or any type of ferromagnetic implanted material). After a complete description of the study was given to participants, written informed consent was obtained following the guidelines of the University of Nebraska Medical Center’s Institutional Review Board, which approved the study protocol. 
 
 
 Experimental Paradigm 
 During MEG recording, participants were seated in a nonmagnetic chair within a magnetically-shielded room and instructed to fixate on a crosshair presented centrally for 1.0 s. A grid containing six letters was then presented for 2.0 s (encoding). The letters then disappeared from the grid and 3.0 s later (maintenance phase) a single “probe” letter appeared for 0.9 s (retrieval phase). Participants were instructed to respond with a button press as to whether the probe letter was one of the six letters previously presented. The crosshair was present throughout the entire task to reduce the likelihood of eye saccades. Each trial lasted 6.9 s, including a 1.0 s pre-stimulus fixation; see  Figure 1  for an illustration of the overall task design. Each participant completed 128 trials and the task lasted approximately 14 minutes. 
 
 
 MEG data acquisition 
 Recordings were conducted in a one-layer magnetically-shielded room with active shielding engaged. With an acquisition bandwidth of 0.1–330 Hz, neuromagnetic responses were sampled continuously at 1 kHz using an Elekta MEG system with 306 magnetic sensors (Elekta, Helsinki, Finland). MEG data from each subject were individually corrected for head motion and subjected to noise reduction using the signal space separation method with a temporal extension ( Taulu and Simola, 2006 ;  Taulu, et al., 2005 ). 
 
 
 MEG Coregistration & Structural MRI Processing 
 Preceding MEG measurement, four coils were attached to the subject’s head and localized, together with the three fiducial points and scalp surface, with a 3-D digitizer (Fastrak 3SF0002, Polhemus Navigator Sciences, Colchester, VT, USA). Once the subject was positioned for MEG recording, an electric current with a unique frequency label (e.g., 322 Hz) was fed to each of the coils. This induced a measurable magnetic field and allowed each coil to be localized in reference to the sensors throughout the recording session. Since coil locations were also known in head coordinates, all MEG measurements could be transformed into a common coordinate system. With this coordinate system, each participant’s MEG data were coregistered with structural T1-weighted MRI data prior to source space analyses using BESA MRI (Version 2.0; BESA GmbH, Gräfelfing, Germany). Structural MRI data were aligned parallel to the anterior and posterior commissures and were transformed into standardized space after beamforming. 
 
 
 MEG Time-Frequency Transformation and Statistics 
 Cardio-artifacts were removed from the data using signal-space projection (SSP), which was accounted for during source reconstruction ( Uusitalo and Ilmoniemi, 1997 ). The continuous magnetic time series was divided into epochs of 6.9 s duration, with the baseline being defined as −0.4 to 0.0 s before initial stimulus onset (see  Figure 1 ). Epochs containing artifacts were rejected based on a fixed threshold method, supplemented with visual inspection. Artifact-free epochs were transformed into the time-frequency domain using complex demodulation with a resolution of 1.0 Hz and 50 ms ( Hoechstetter, et al., 2004 ;  Papp and Ktonas, 1977 ), and the resulting spectral power estimations per sensor were averaged over trials to generate time-frequency plots of mean spectral density. These sensor-level data were normalized by dividing the power value of each time-frequency bin by the respective bin’s baseline power, which was calculated as the mean power during the −0.4 to 0.0 s time period. 
 The time-frequency windows used for imaging were determined by statistical analysis of the sensor-level spectrograms across the entire array of gradiometers during the five-second “encoding” and “maintenance” time window. Each data point in the spectrogram was initially evaluated using a mass univariate approach based on the general linear model (GLM). To reduce the risk of false positive results while maintaining reasonable sensitivity, a two stage procedure was followed to control for Type 1 error. In the first stage, one-sample  t -tests were conducted on each data point and the output spectrogram of t-values was thresholded at  p  < .05 to define time-frequency bins containing potentially significant oscillatory deviations across all participants. In stage two, time-frequency bins that survived the threshold were clustered with temporally and/or spectrally neighboring bins that were also significant at the ( p  < .05) threshold, and a cluster value was derived by summing all of the  t -values of all data points in the cluster. Nonparametric permutation testing was then used to derive a distribution of cluster-values and the significance level of the observed clusters (from stage one) were tested directly using this distribution ( Ernst, 2004 ;  Maris and Oostenveld, 2007 ). For each comparison, at least 10,000 permutations were computed to build a distribution of cluster values. Based on these analyses, only the time-frequency windows that contained significant oscillatory events across all younger and older participants during the encoding and maintenance phases were subjected to the beamforming (i.e., imaging) analysis. Thus, a purely data-driven approach was utilized when selecting the time-frequency windows to be imaged. This objective approach was employed due to the notable variability in the time-frequency windows analyzed across various neurophysiological studies on working memory. 
 
 
 MEG Source Imaging & Statistics 
 Cortical networks were imaged through an extension of the linearly constrained minimum variance vector beamformer ( Hillebrand, et al., 2005 ;  Liljestrom, et al., 2005 ;  Van Veen, et al., 1997 ), which employs spatial filters in the frequency domain to calculate source power for the entire brain volume. The single images are derived from the cross spectral densities of all combinations of MEG gradiometers averaged over the time-frequency range of interest, and the solution of the forward problem for each location on a grid specified by input voxel space. Following convention, the source power in these images was normalized per participant using a separately averaged pre-stimulus noise period of equal duration and bandwidth ( Van Veen, et al., 1997 ). MEG pre-processing and imaging used the Brain Electrical Source Analysis (version 6.0) software. 
 Normalized source power was computed for the selected time-frequency bands over the entire brain volume per participant at 4.0 × 4.0 × 4.0 mm resolution. Preceding statistical analysis, each participant’s functional images were transformed into standardized space using the transform that was previously applied to the structural images. The resulting 3D maps of brain activity were averaged across participants in each group to assess the neuroanatomical basis of significant oscillatory responses identified through the sensor-level analysis. In addition, these images were statistically evaluated using a random effects, mass univariate approach based on the GLM. The effect of group (i.e., older vs. younger) was determined using two-tailed independent-samples  t -tests per time-frequency bin. All output statistical maps were displayed as a function of alpha level, thresholded at  p  < 0.005, and adjusted for multiple comparisons using a spatial extent threshold (i.e., cluster restriction;  k =  200 contiguous voxels) based on the theory of Gaussian random fields ( Poline, et al., 1995 ;  Worsley, et al., 1999 ;  Worsley, et al., 1996 ). Of note, we also conducted nonparametric permutation testing to control for Type 1 error in the group comparison SPMs, using a cluster-based method similar to that performed on the sensor-level spectrograms, and our results were virtually identical (see  Supplementary Materials ). 
 
 
 Regression Analysis 
 Hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to examine statistical relationships between behavioral performance, oscillatory activity, and age. For each participant, accuracy was computed by dividing the number of correct trials by the total number of trials completed. The amplitude of the peak group difference voxel was obtained by identifying the time bin containing the largest difference in neural activation between older and younger participants and extracting the value of this voxel for each participant. Peak voxel value and age were centered and accuracy was regressed on both variables in the first block, and their interaction term in the second block. To understand the nature of the interaction, post-hoc probing was executed using the approach developed by Aiken and West ( Aiken and West, 1991 ). 
 
 
 
 Results 
 
 Behavioral Analysis 
 All 31 participants successfully completed the task. Both older and younger participants performed well, accurately identifying the probe 81.32% ( SD  = 8.04%) and 84.30% ( SD  = 6.66%), respectively, of all trials. Only correct trials were used for analysis. There were no significant differences in accuracy between older and younger participants  t (29) = 1.12,  p  = .270. 
 
 
 Sensor-Level Analysis 
 Statistical analyses of the time-frequency spectrograms revealed a significant cluster of alpha/low-beta (9–16 Hz) oscillatory activity in central and posterior gradiometers across all participants ( p  < .001, corrected;  Figure 2 ). This alpha/beta activity began 0.2 s after onset of the encoding grid, was sustained throughout the encoding phase, and terminated at 2.5 s (i.e., 0.5 s into the maintenance phase). Additionally, a significant cluster of alpha (9–12 Hz) activity was observed during the maintenance phase in roughly the same group of sensors ( p  < .001, corrected;  Figure 2 ). This alpha activity began at 3.0 s (i.e., 1.0 s into the maintenance phase), was sustained throughout the remainder of the maintenance phase, and sharply dissipated early in the retrieval phase. Since these responses spanned across the encoding and maintenance phases, respectively, we split them into 0.4 s non-overlapping time bins and subjected each time-frequency window to beamformer analysis in each participant. 
 
 
 Beamformer Analysis 
 To evaluate the neural dynamics serving working memory performance, we initially examined the time course of activity in each group ( Figure 3 ). These data indicated a strong decrease in alpha/beta activity beginning early in the encoding phase in the bilateral occipital cortices and cerebellum, which rapidly spread to left superior temporal regions, supramarginal, and inferior frontal gyri. Such decreases in alpha/beta activity were sustained throughout the encoding phase in left fronto-temporal cortices, with the frontal activity beginning to dissipate early in the maintenance phase. Meanwhile, alpha activity in the left superior temporal cortices extended throughout the maintenance phase. Generally, the spatiotemporal dynamics of left fronto-temporal activity were similar in younger and older adults ( Figure 3 ). 
 In regard to group differences, as hypothesized, we found significant age-related effects in alpha/beta activity in the right PFC throughout the majority of the encoding and maintenance phases ( p  < .005, corrected;  Figure 4  and  Table 1 ). During the latter half of encoding, older adults exhibited a largely sustained decrease in alpha/beta activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) stretching from 1.0 to 3.0 s, which was clearly absent in younger adults. Later in the time course, we found a similar pattern of decreased alpha activity in the right IFG, right superior temporal gyrus (STG), and right middle frontal gyrus of older participants from 3.8 to 4.2 s ( p  < .005, corrected;  Figure 4 ). Finally, such decreased alpha activity in the older group was sustained throughout the remainder of the maintenance phase (i.e., until 5.0 s) in the right IFG/STG cluster. Additionally, in congruence with our hypotheses, we observed stronger alpha activity in the bilateral parieto-occipital cortices of older participants during early maintenance (i.e., 2.6 to 3.0 s), with alpha transitioning from a desynchronization (decrease relative to baseline) to a synchronization (increase) in younger participants during this same temporal period ( p  < .005, corrected; see  Figure 5 ). Analysis of the dynamics indicated that younger participants eventually exhibited an increase in parieto-occipital alpha during the maintenance phase, but this increase occurred earlier and encompassed more cortical tissue in older relative to younger participants. 
 We also found significant age-related differences beyond those which were anticipated. Specifically, during early encoding, younger adults exhibited decreased alpha/beta activity in the right inferior temporal sulcus and temporoparietal area (0.2 – 0.6 s; p < .005, corrected;  Figure 4 ), as well as a much stronger decrease in alpha/beta activity in bilateral occipital regions and cerebellar cortices during most of the encoding phase (0.2 – 1.4 s;  p  < .005, corrected). Younger adults also had a stronger decrease in alpha/beta activity during encoding in bilateral supramarginal and angular gyri ( Figure 6 ), left posterior superior temporal regions (0.2 – 1.0 s), and the left inferior temporal sulcus/gyrus (0.6 – 1.0 s;  p  < .005, corrected). Interestingly, slightly later during the early maintenance phase, older adults had a stronger decrease in oscillatory activity in largely the same left supramarginal and posterior temporal regions ( p  < .005, corrected). 
 
 
 Regression Analysis 
 To identify whether age and region-specific oscillatory activity were predictive of behavioral performance, multiple regression was performed. For this analysis, we focused on the right PFC, as the largest group difference occurred in this region during the 4.6 to 5.0 s time window (see  Figure 4 ), and oscillatory differences in this brain area were likely our most important finding. To this end, we extracted the value of the peak voxel (coordinates: 53, 11, 2) for each participant. These data and participant age were statistically centered and prepared for regression analysis (see Methods). 
 The interaction between age and neural activity in the right PFC for accuracy was significant, Δ R 2  = .13, Δ F  = 4.87,  p  = .036, β = .40,  b  = 0.03,  t (27) = 2.21, CI [0.002, 0.052], above and beyond the effects of age and peak voxel value (see  Table 2 ). Age significantly moderated the relationship between right PFC activity and accuracy, and this interaction accounted for 13% of the variance in accuracy. The full model accounted for 30% of the variance in accuracy,  R 2  = .30,  F (3, 27) = 3.79,  p  = .022. 
 Post-hoc probing of the interaction demonstrated that at younger ages, right PFC activity significantly and uniquely predicted accuracy, β = −.91,  b  = −1.02,  t (27) = −2.58,  p  = .016, CI [−1.83, −0.21] (see  Table 3 ), such that as peak alpha activity decreased in this brain region, accuracy on the working memory task was expected to increase (see  Figure 7 ). At older ages, the relationship between right PFC activity and accuracy was not significant, β = −.03,  b  = −0.04,  t (27) = −0.15,  p  = .884, CI [−0.55, 0.48] (see  Table 3 ). 
 
 
 
 Discussion 
 In the present study, we utilized high-density MEG to investigate age-related differences in the neural oscillatory dynamics of the encoding and maintenance operations of working memory processing. In each age group, our data indicated a sharp decrease in alpha/beta activity that began in bilateral occipital regions immediately during encoding. This decrease in alpha/beta activity spread anterior to include left temporal and frontal cortices during the latter half of encoding, narrowed to the alpha band and grew in magnitude during early maintenance, and dissipated throughout the latter half of maintenance. This pattern of decreased left hemispheric oscillatory activity was remarkably similar in younger and older adults. This work corroborates and extends previous imaging work, which has shown that verbal working memory activates a network of left hemispheric language regions. As for age-related differences, the neural dynamics distinguished younger and older participants in the left hemispheric regions noted above, as well as parieto-occipital areas, but our most important findings involved homologous regions in the right hemisphere. Essentially, differences emerged in the right STG and supramarginal gyrus (i.e., homologue of Wernicke’s area) during early encoding, and later older adults exhibited a sharp, sustained decrease in the right IFG (i.e., homologue of Broca’s area). Finally, our results indicated that oscillatory amplitude in the right PFC was a strong predictor of accuracy in younger, but not older adults, which provides new supporting data for theories of how aging modulates functional brain networks. Below, we discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the dynamics of working memory processing, and the modulatory effects that healthy aging has on the inherent function and dynamics in these networks. 
 The extensive oscillatory responses observed in the left hemisphere were not surprising, especially when considering Baddeley’s neurocognitive model of working memory, which divides the working memory construct into four subcomponents ( Baddeley, 1992 ;  Baddeley, 2000 ). Previous neuroimaging work has suggested that certain neuroanatomical locations underlie the functioning of these four subsystems. The phonological loop is believed to be tied to language areas in the left hemisphere, specifically Wernicke’s area which encompasses left inferior parietal and posterior temporal regions. This area is thought to be involved in the temporary storage of verbal information (i.e., the phonological store), and has been widely implicated in language comprehension ( Cabeza and Nyberg, 2000 ;  D’Esposito, 2007 ). Left prefrontal regions (e.g., Broca’s area) are also believed to be critical for language processing and the maintenance of verbal information (i.e., the articulatory loop) during working memory performance ( Cabeza and Nyberg, 2000 ;  D’Esposito, 2007 ;  D’Esposito and Postle, 2015 ;  Reuter-Lorenz, et al., 2000 ). Considering our task involved language-related stimuli (i.e., letters), oscillatory responses in both the left PFC and Wernicke’s area were expected throughout much of encoding and maintenance, and we observed such in both age groups, although these responses were slightly delayed in the older group. The involvement of these brain areas is consistent with another MEG study, which reported decreased activity in Wernicke’s area, as well as the medial frontal cortex and bilateral frontal operculum during a Sternberg task ( Brookes, et al., 2011 ). Additionally, our results complement two fMRI meta-analyses that suggested greater activity in left hemispheric language areas during performance on verbal-based memory tasks ( Cabeza and Nyberg, 2000 ;  Rottschy, et al., 2012 ). Importantly, multiple EEG-fMRI studies have demonstrated negative correlations between alpha oscillatory activity and fMRI activation during cognitive tasks in general ( Murta, et al., 2015 ;  Scheeringa, et al., 2011 ), and specifically between decreased alpha/low-beta activity and increased fMRI activation in language areas during a working memory task ( Michels, et al., 2010 ). Thus, our results further support the role of these areas in verbal working memory performance across age groups. 
 This study’s most important findings were likely the age-related differences in alpha/beta (9–16 Hz) oscillatory activity observed in the right IFG and STG during encoding and maintenance. Essentially, older adults exhibited a sustained decrease in alpha/beta activity during the second half of encoding in the right IFG, which narrowed to the alpha band (9–12 Hz) and spread to encompass the right STG during late maintenance; such oscillatory responses were not observed in younger adults during these spatiotemporal windows. Thus, during the latter half of encoding and through most of maintenance, both groups exhibited decreased power in Broca’s area, but only older adults also had decreased activity in its right-hemisphere homologue. These results are exciting in that they are largely congruent with an influential hypothesis concerning neurocognitive aging: the compensation hypothesis. This well-supported hypothesis ( Cabeza, 2002 ;  Cabeza, et al., 2002 ;  Cabeza, et al., 2004 ;  Cabeza, et al., 1997 ;  Davis, et al., 2008 ;  Eyler, et al., 2011 ;  Fakhri, et al., 2012 ;  Grady, 2012 ;  Grady, et al., 2005 ;  Greenwood, 2007 ;  Mattay, et al., 2006 ;  Park and Reuter-Lorenz, 2009 ;  Reuter-Lorenz, et al., 2000 ;  Reuter-Lorenz, 2008 ;  Saliasi, et al., 2014 ;  Spreng, et al., 2010 ;  Turner and Spreng, 2012 ) posits that when older adults engage greater volumes of brain tissue relative to younger adults, particularly in regards to the PFC, the increase in neural activity serves as a compensatory mechanism to aid cognitive performance and counteract age-related declines ( Cabeza, 2002 ;  Reuter-Lorenz, et al., 2000 ). Oftentimes, such age-related differences are strongest in the hemisphere that is non-dominant for the specific cognitive function (e.g., right hemisphere in language tasks), and thus activation appears more bilateral in the older adults ( Cabeza, 2002 ;  Cabeza, et al., 2002 ;  Emery, et al., 2008 ;  Reuter-Lorenz, et al., 2000 ;  Spreng, et al., 2010 ). The functional significance of the decreased alpha activity we observed in these critical brain regions also aligns with the compensation hypothesis, as decreased alpha activity has been theorized to reflect a release from inhibition and/or engagement of the specific area during a task ( Klimesch, 2012 ;  Klimesch, et al., 2007 ). Thus, the persistent and strong decrease in alpha activity we observed in older adults in not only Broca’s area (i.e., an area associated with the articulatory loop), but also its right hemisphere homologue, likely reflected the engagement of compensatory resources for the rehearsal and maintenance of the information to be remembered. 
 Given the influential role of the PFC in theories of neurocognitive aging, we aimed to more closely examine its relationship with behavioral performance and age, as the compensation hypothesis is most strongly supported when behavioral performance remains equal between groups, despite older adults engaging more neural resources than younger adults ( Grady, 2012 ), which occurred in the present study. Thus, we performed a hierarchical regression analysis to determine if age differentially moderated the relationship between oscillatory activity in the right IFG (i.e., loci of largest group difference) and behavioral performance. Note that these results should be interpreted with caution, as we did not test all brain regions where group differences were observed, and consequently there is some potential for bias in the interaction analysis by selecting the area which demonstrated the greatest age-related difference. Nevertheless, our results were somewhat surprising in that a significant relationship was observed for only the younger group, wherein greater decreases in alpha activity within the right IFG were predictive of better accuracy. We propose that these data are consistent with the compensation-related utilization of neural circuits hypothesis (CRUNCH; ( Reuter-Lorenz, 2008 ). CRUNCH extends upon the compensation hypothesis by clarifying that, under lower cognitive demands, older adults engage greater volumes of cortical tissue during task performance relative to younger adults, which aids in successful performance. However, under higher demands, older adults have already exhausted their compensatory circuits and reached a resource ceiling, resulting in poorer task performance. Meanwhile, younger adults are able to engage these compensatory circuits to meet the increased cognitive demands. Support for CRUNCH comes from neuroimaging studies that showed that age-related differences in PFC activation varied with task demands ( Cappell, et al., 2010 ;  Mattay, et al., 2006 ). For example,  Cappell et al. (2010)  found that at a moderate memory load (i.e., 5 letters), older adults displayed an over-activation within the right dorsolateral PFC relative to younger adults, but at a higher memory load (i.e., 7 letters) older adults exhibited an under-activation within the same region relative to younger adults. Our task used a 6-letter memory load, which is at the more demanding end for a Sternberg task. Thus, a neural resources ceiling may have been reached by the older adults, accounting for the plateau that we observed between neural activity and accuracy in this group. However, additional neural resources were likely still available in the younger group, resulting in the relationship we observed between neural activity and accuracy in this group. 
 In addition to the age-related differences observed in anterior regions, we hypothesized differences in parieto-occipital cortices, which were also supported by our results. Specifically, age-related differences in oscillatory activity were found in bilateral parieto-occipital areas during early maintenance. Older adults exhibited a sharp increase in parieto-occipital alpha activity during early maintenance, which continued throughout maintenance, dissipating to only right-lateralized regions towards retrieval. Younger adults exhibited a similar increase in parieto-occipital alpha during maintenance, but the onset was delayed and the activity was more lateralized. Thus, parieto-occipital alpha activity began earlier and engaged more neural tissue during maintenance in older relative to younger adults. Previous neurophysiological studies have reported similar parieto-occipital alpha oscillations during working memory maintenance in healthy young adults ( Bennett, et al., 2013 ;  Bonnefond and Jensen, 2012 ;  Bonnefond and Jensen, 2013 ;  Jensen, et al., 2002 ;  Jiang, et al., 2015 ;  Tuladhar, et al., 2007 ). An influential theory posits that such alpha activity reflects the inhibition of the dorsal visual stream, which functions to protect items (e.g., letters) that are being retained in more anterior regions (e.g. Broca’s area) from being disturbed by incoming visual information ( Bonnefond and Jensen, 2012 ;  Jensen, et al., 2002 ;  Jensen and Mazaheri, 2010 ;  Klimesch, et al., 2007 ;  Tuladhar, et al., 2007 ). In line with this, we propose that the earlier and more widespread parieto-occipital alpha activity that we observed in older relative to younger adults reflects an additional compensatory mechanism, which further aids working memory performance in older age. 
 Before closing, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of this study. First, several electrophysiological studies of working memory have reported theta activity ( Brookes, et al., 2011 ;  Jensen and Tesche, 2002 ;  Onton, et al., 2005 ), whereas we did not find significant theta. Interestingly, the previous studies that reported frontal theta used sequentially presented stimuli, whereas our stimuli were presented simultaneously and this may account for the divergence in theta results. Additionally, the simultaneous presentation of our stimuli may have been more susceptible to eye movements during the encoding period, relative to sequential designs. However, working memory meta-analyses and reviews, which incorporated studies that used sequential designs, reported similar patterns of activity regarding left hemispheric language regions ( Cabeza and Nyberg, 2000 ;  Hill, et al., 2014 ;  Nee, et al., 2013 ;  Owen, et al., 2005 ;  Rottschy, et al., 2012 ) and bilateral activity in older adults ( Grady, 2012 ;  Spreng, et al., 2010 ). This converging evidence, coupled with the fact that we did not observe effects in the frontal eye fields nor the orbitofrontal cortices, suggests that our results were not contaminated by eye movement artifacts. Lastly, our study was limited in its restriction to only adult males, although this was by design. A recent meta-analysis highlighted sex-related differences in working memory processing and we aimed to avoid such confounding variables in the current study ( Hill, et al., 2014 ). Future MEG studies of working memory should focus on female participants. 
 
 
 Conclusions 
 The present study utilized advanced MEG imaging of the neural oscillatory activity that underlies working memory processing to provide novel insight into age-related differences in the dynamics of encoding and maintenance. The results of this study were the first to identify the neural dynamics evolving during successful working memory encoding and maintenance in an older adult sample, and to demonstrate that aging modulates the relationship between oscillatory activity and behavioral working memory performance. These results provide invaluable insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics that serve working memory functions in older adults, as well as how healthy aging modulates functional brain networks. Additionally, our results provided partial support for both the compensation hypothesis and the CRUNCH.

 Figure 1 
 
 Modified Sternberg Working Memory Paradigm. Each trial was comprised of four phases: A) a fixation phase which lasted for 1.0 s, B) an encoding phase (red text) in which a grid containing six letters was presented for 2.0 s, C) a maintenance phase (blue text) in which the letter stimuli were removed from the grid for 3.0 s, and D) a retrieval phase in which one probe letter was presented for 0.9 s and the participant responded as to whether it had been included in the previous encoding set. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 2 
 
 Time-frequency spectogram with time shown on the x-axis and frequency (Hz) denoted on the y-axis. Percent power change was computed by dividing the mean power of each time-frequency bin by the respective bin’s baseline power (−.4 to 0 s) and multiplying this value by 100. The color legend is displayed to the right. Data represent a group-averaged peak sensor, collapsed across age groups, located near the parieto-occipital cortex. The chip where this sensor was precisely located is shown in the 2-dimensional plot of the sensor array that appears on the far right. Strong alpha/beta desynchronization was observed shortly after the encoding grid was presented, and this evolved into a narrower alpha synchronization during maintenance. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 3 
 
 Group mean beamformer images (pseudo-t) at 70% transparency for younger (top) and older (bottom) adults are displayed across all time bins spanning the encoding (red labels) and maintenance (blue labels) phases. Across age groups, there was a strong sustained decrease in alpha/beta oscillatory activity in left hemispheric brain regions throughout most of the encoding and maintenance phases. This decrease began in posterior regions early in the encoding phase, spread anterior to include left fronto-temporal areas, including language areas, during the latter half of encoding and early maintenance period, and dissipated slightly throughout the remainder of the maintenance phase. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 4 
 
 Significant group differences ( p  < .005) in alpha/beta oscillatory activity in the right hemisphere are displayed across all time bins spanning the encoding (red labels) and maintenance (blue labels) phases. Age-related differences in the right angular gyrus began immediately following the onset of the encoding grid and spread to include right supramarginal gyrus (i.e., homologue of Wernicke’s area) before terminating in the latter half of the encoding phase (see  Figure 6  for complimentary views). These group differences were attributable to an early decrease in alpha/beta activity in younger adults, which was not observed in older adults. Additionally, age-related differences in the right inferior frontal gyrus (i.e., homologue of Broca’s area) began in the latter half of the encoding phase at 1.0 s, and persisted throughout the majority of the remaining time bins, spreading to include superior temporal regions during the latter half of the maintenance phase. These differences reflect decreased alpha/beta activity in older adults, with stable activity in younger adults. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 5 
 
 Group mean beamformer images (pseudo-t) for younger and older adults are displayed on the top and middle rows, respectively, for the first three time bins of the maintenance phase. The bottom row displays significant group differences ( p  < .005, corrected) in alpha oscillatory activity. Younger adults showed a shift from a bilateral decrease in alpha activity in the occipital cortices to a right-lateralized increase in alpha activity in parieto-occipital areas. Conversely, older adults demonstrated a sustained increase in alpha activity across bilateral occipital cortices, with the increased alpha occurring earlier and involving more cortical tissue in older adults relative to younger adults. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 6 
 
 Significant group differences ( p  < .005) in alpha/beta oscillatory activity in bilateral supramarginal and angular gyri (i.e., Wernicke’s area and its right hemisphere homologue) during early encoding (0.6 – 1.0 s). The left panel shows a sagittal view of left hemispheric differences, while the right panel depicts a coronal view of the simultaneous bilateral differences (see  Figure 4 , time bin 0.6 – 1.0 s for a sagittal view of right hemispheric differences). These group differences were attributable to a decrease in alpha/beta activity in younger adults, which was not observed in older adults. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 7 
 
 Line graph depicting the interaction between age and right prefrontal cortex (PFC; i.e., homologue of Broca’s area) oscillatory activity for accuracy on the working memory task. Peak voxel amplitude is depicted on the  x -axis, with decreased activity signifying lower peak voxel values and increased activity signifying higher peak voxel values. Accuracy is on the  y -axis in percent units. Younger ages (i.e., one standard deviation below age) are depicted by the black solid line, while older ages (i.e., one standard deviation above age) are depicted by the black dashed line. At younger ages, right PFC activity was significantly predictive of accuracy (controlling for age and the interaction term) such that, as activity decreased, accuracy was expected to increase. At older ages, right PFC activity and accuracy were not significantly related (controlling for age and the interaction term).
