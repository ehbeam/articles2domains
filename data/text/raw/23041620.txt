 Objective 
 The Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) is a key measure of social cognition in schizophrenia that has good psychometric properties and is recommended by the MATRICS committee. As a way to further investigate the validity of the MSCEIT, this study sought to examine the neurobiological correlates of MSCEIT performance in patients with early course schizophrenia. 
 
 
 Methods 
 A total of 51 patients diagnosed with early course, stabilized schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder completed structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and the MSCEIT. Investigation of the associations between MSCEIT performance and gray matter morphology was examined by conducting voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analyses across hypothesized social-cognitive regions of interest using automated anatomical labeling in Statistical Parametric Mapping Software, version 5 (SPM5). All VBM analyses utilized general linear models examining gray matter density partitioned images, adjusting for demographic and illness-related confounds. VBM results were then followed up with confirmatory volumetric analyses. 
 
 
 Results 
 Patients with poorer overall and Facilitating, Understanding, and Managing Emotions subscale performances on the MSCEIT showed significantly reduced gray matter density in the left parahippocampal gyrus. Additionally, attenuated performance on the Facilitating and Managing Emotions subscales was significantly associated with reduced right posterior cingulate gray matter density. All associations observed between MSCEIT performance and gray matter density were supported with confirmatory gray matter volumetric analyses, with the exception of the association between the right posterior cingulate and the facilitation of emotions. 
 
 
 Conclusion 
 These findings provide additional evidence for the MSCEIT as a valid social-cognitive measure by elucidating its correlates with neurobiological structures commonly implicated in emotion processing. These findings provide additional biological evidence supporting the use of the MSCEIT in cognitive enhancing clinical trials in schizophrenia.

 1. Introduction 
 Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia is now considered a central characteristic of the disorder ( Heinrichs and Zakzanis, 1998 ;  Keefe and Fenton, 2007 ), with recent evidence recognizing the particularly important contribution of social-cognitive impairments on functional outcomes ( Couture et al., 2006 ;  Green and Horan, 2010 ;  Vauth et al., 2004 ). Despite recognition of the centrality of social-cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, the availability of tools for the assessment of social cognition in the disorder has been limited ( Green et al., 2004 ). The Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT;  Mayer et al., 2003 ) has emerged as a promising measure of social cognition in schizophrenia. Indeed, the National Institute of Mental Health’s (NIMH) committee on Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) has recommended that the MSCEIT be the key measure for assessing social-cognitive outcomes in clinical trials of cognitive enhancers in schizophrenia ( Green et al., 2005 ). Additionally, previous investigations of the MSCEIT have demonstrated strong psychometric properties for assessing the emotional components of social cognition in the disorder ( Eack et al., 2010 ;  Kee et al., 2009 ;  Nuechterlein et al., 2008 ), and has also documented the sensitivity of the MSCEIT for detecting social-cognitive treatment effects ( Eack et al., 2007 ), underscoring its potential utility for use in clinical trials. 
 A critical component to the continued validation of the MSCEIT is the identification of the neural underpinnings that subserve performance on the test. Indeed, a myriad of evidence has indicated an increasingly clear neurobiological basis for social cognition and emotion processing in healthy control samples ( Adolphs, 2001 ;  Amodio and Frith, 2006 ;  Lieberman, 2007 ;  Maddock et al., 2003 ;  Saxe, 2006 ), with schizophrenia patients displaying impairments in similar brain regions. Such structural and functional abnormalities include regions of the prefrontal cortex (e.g., orbitofrontal cortex and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex), the insula, the medial-temporal lobe (e.g., amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and fusiform gyrus), the cuneus, and the cingulate gyrus ( Benedetti et al., 2009 ;  Pinkham et al., 2008 ;  Pinkham et al., 2003 ;  Yamada et al., 2007 ). Therefore, the success of the MSCEIT to detect social-cognitive impairments in schizophrenia could depend on associations between poorer performance on the measure and increased structural abnormalities in these social-cognitive brain regions. 
 To our knowledge, no study has identified the neurobiological correlates of MSCEIT performance or its association with structural deficits in schizophrenia using brain morphometry.  Hooker et al. (2012)  observed a post social-cognitive training increase in postcentral gryus functioning using fMRI that predicted improved MSCEIT performance on the Perceiving Emotions subscale. Deficits in management of emotions measured by the MSCEIT have also been linked to 5-HT2A gene variation in schizophrenia patients ( Lo et al., 2010 ). In an effort to further investigate the validity of the MSCEIT for assessing social cognition in schizophrenia, we examined the neural correlates between performance on the MSCEIT and gray matter morphology in a sample of patients in the early course of the disorder. We hypothesized that patients with greater performance impairments on the MSCEIT would have lower gray matter densities in fronto-temporal brain regions previously associated with social-cognitive deficits in schizophrenia ( Pinkham et al., 2003 ;  Yamada et al., 2007 ). 
 
 
 2. Methods 
 
 2.1. Participants 
 Participation in this study included 51 stabilized, early-course outpatients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia ( n  =34) or schizoaffective disorder ( n  = 17) confirmed by the Structural Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV ( First, Spitzer, Gibbon, & Williams, 2002 ). The early course of schizophrenia was defined by the onset of first, untreated psychotic symptoms within the past 8 years. Eligibility criteria for the study included a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder; emergence of first psychotic symptoms within the past 8 years (including duration of untreated illness); an IQ ≥ 80; a two month duration free of drug and alcohol abuse prior to study enrollment; and social and cognitive disability assessed using the Cognitive Style and Social Cognition Eligibility Interview ( Hogarty et al., 2004 ). 
 The participants in this study were young and early in the course of their illness with an average age of 25.87 ( SD  = 6.13) and an illness duration of 3.28 ( SD  = 2.21) years. All participants were taking an antipsychotic medication. The average chlorpromazine equivalent (CPZ) was 403.36 ( SD  = 311.97). Majority of the participants were taking an atyptical antipsychotic ( n =  45; 88%), 1 prescribed a typical antipsychotic (2%), and 5 taking both an atypical and typical antipsychotic medication (10%). The majority of patients were male ( n  = 34; 67%) and Caucasian ( n  = 35, 68%). At the time of this research, 37 (72.5%) participants were college educated, while only 14 (27.5%) were employed. Participants in the study were part of a larger randomized-controlled trial of Cognitive Enhancement Therapy ( Eack et al., 2009 ) 
 
 
 2.2. Procedure 
 Participants were recruited from Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic and other community clinics in Pittsburgh, PA. Utilizing video-taped interviews of participants, consensus conferences were implemented to determine eligibility for study participation. Those patients meeting inclusion criteria were then assessed with the MSCEIT and measures of brain morphology described above. All patients provided written informed consent prior to participation, and the study protocol was reviewed annually by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board. 
 
 
 2.3. Measures 
 
 2.3.1 Social Cognition 
 The MSCEIT ( Mayer et al., 2003 ) is a computer-administered, performance-based measure of emotion processing and management, which is recommended by the NIMH-MATRICS committee for assessing social cognition in schizophrenia ( Nuechterlein et al., 2008 ). The MSCEIT consists of 141-items assessing the four branches of emotional intelligence presented by  Mayer and Salovey (1997) . Scores for the four subscales and overall performances are based on a scale of a large normative sample with a mean of 100 (SD = 15). A higher score indicates a better emotional intelligence quotient. The subscale branches include an individual’s ability to accurately perceive, understand, and manage emotions and to utilize emotions to facilitate thinking. The ability to perceive emotions is assessed by identifying emotions in pictures of human faces and scenery. The understanding of emotions is assessed by identifying how emotions are combined to produce other emotions. The management of emotions is measured by recognizing how emotions change with intensity and identifying correct strategies to regulate one’s own and others emotions in certain social situations. The ability to use emotions to facilitate thinking is assessed by matching emotions with sensations and judging which emotions are required to facilitate thoughts and behaviors ( Mayer et al., 2003 ). The MSCEIT has been previously shown to have good reliability and adequate discriminate construct and concurrent validity for assessing the emotional components of social cognition in patients with schizophrenia ( Eack et al., 2010 ;  Nuechterlein et al., 2008 ). 
 
 
 2.3.2. Brain Morphology 
 Assessments of brain morphology were conducted using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a 3-T Signa whole body scanner and head coil (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI). Whole brain volume was acquired in 124 1.5 mm-thick contiguous coronal slices with spoiled gradient recalled acquisition in steady state pulse sequence (TE = 5 ms, TR = 25 ms, acquisition matrix = 256 × 192, FOV = 24 cm). A masters-level imaging research assistant examined the images manually for quality and motion. Images were then normalized to standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space and segmented using the unified segmentation algorithm to produce unmodulated gray matter partitioned images ( Ashburner and Friston, 2005 ) based on templates of adults brains in Statistical Parametric Mapping Software, version 5 (SPM5) (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, Institute of Neurology, London, UK). To provide the best balance between minimal intersubject variability and maximal analytic sensitivity, the unmodulated, segmented images were smoothed using a 12 mm Gaussian Kernel and radio frequency inhomogeneity artifacts were corrected using a bias correction algorithm built into the segmentation procedure. Prior to analysis, the Wake Forest University PickAtlas toolbox for SPM5 ( Maldjian et al., 2003 ) was used to define image masks for region of interest (ROI) analyses of gray matter regions that have been previously implicated in social cognition ( Adolphs, 2001 ;  Taylor et al., 2012 ). Regional definitions were delineated by  Tzourio-Mazoyer and colleagues (2002) , and included the orbitofrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, fusiform gyrus, amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and cuneus. 
 
 
 
 2.4. Data analysis 
 Analyses began with a series of ROI voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analyses employing general linear models executed in SPM5 utilizing the normalized, unmodulated segmented, and smoothed images described above. Results of MSCEIT-related brain morphology will reflect gray matter density since these images are  not  modulated by their Jacobian determinants. Because the MSCEIT is based on a four factor model of emotional intelligence ( Mayer and Salovey, 1997 ), five individual multiple regression designs were implemented for each of the MSCEIT subscales scores (e.g., Perceiving, Facilitating, Understanding, and Managing Emotions) and total scores. All the above analyses controlled for possible confounding effects of age, gender, and illness length. Correction for multiple inference testing was handled with Monte Carlo simulations produced with AlphaSim ( Ward, 2000 ), which indicated a combined voxel-extent threshold of 59 contiguous voxels and an α threshold of .001 was sufficient to keep the study-wise Type 1 error rate at .047 across all VBM analyses. To increase confidence in our VBM findings of associations between gray matter density and MSCEIT performance, subsequent confirmatory volumetric analyses were completed in SPSSv.19 using partial correlation analyses adjusting for age, gender, illness length, and total intracranial volume. This was accomplished by extracting gray matter volumes from segmented images modulated by their Jacobian determinants obtained during image normalization. These images included regions displaying significant associations with MSCEIT performance from the VBM analyses. Results from these volumetric analyses represent gray matter volume instead of density because extracted volumes were obtained from modulated images. Total intracranial volume was included to control for the effects of different brain sizes as Jacobian modulated images were used (umodulated images used above in VBM) in these volumetric analyses, which reflect absolute vs. relative levels of gray matter volume that are affected by variations in brain size. In order to conserve power we only retained confounding variables showing a significant relationship with MSCEIT performance and/or brain morphology. Although antipsychotic medication was considered as a potential confounding variable, CPZ dosage was not correlated with either MSCEIT performance (e.g., total and subscale) or brain morphology, and thus not included in analyses. 
 
 
 
 3. Results 
 
 3.1. MSCEIT Behavioral Performance 
 Table 1  presents MSCEIT overall and subscale performance scores from the sample of early course schizophrenia patients studied in this investigation compared to the normative sample mean of 100 ( Mayer et al., 2003 ). Early course schizophrenia patients displayed significant performance impairments on the MSCEIT overall and the Perceiving, Facilitating, Understanding, and Managing Emotions subscales. The largest domain of impairment was on the Managing Emotions subscale. 
 
 
 3.2. VBM Results of Gray Matter Density ROIs Associated with Impaired MSCEIT Performance 
 Investigation of the neural substrates of impaired MSCEIT performance revealed that patients with poorer overall performance on the MSCEIT showed significant reductions in gray matter density in the left parahippocampal gyrus (see  Table 2  for VBM results). A similar relationship was observed with regard to the individual subscale measures of the MSCEIT. Lower gray matter density in the left parahippocampal gyrus was consistently related to poorer performance on the Facilitating, Understanding, and Managing Emotions subscales. Additionally, gray matter density reduction in the right posterior cingulate was implicated in poorer performance on the Facilitating and Managing Emotions subscales (see  Figure 1 ). No associations were observed between the Perceiving Emotions subscale and lower gray matter density, and no negative associations were found between performance on the MSCEIT (overall and subscale) and gray matter morphology. 
 
 
 3.3. Volumetric Confirmatory Support for the Neurobiological Correlates of Impaired MSCEIT Performance 
 Confirmatory support was observed for the associations between reduced gray matter volume in the left parahippocampal gyrus and overall MSCEIT performance ( pr = 0.31,  p  = 0.033), as well as performance on the Understanding ( pr = 0.34,  r = 0 .017), Managing ( pr = 0.31,  p  = 0.034), and Facilitating ( pr = 0.41,  p  = 0.004) Emotions subscales. Finally, reduced gray matter volume in the right posterior cingulate was also associated with emotion management ( pr  = 0.34,  p  = 0.019; see  Figure 2 ), but not emotion facilitation ( pr = 0.24,  p  = 0.103). Taken together, these findings provide additional evidence for important brain regions implicated in social cognition that are associated with poorer MSCEIT performance in early course schizophrenia. 
 
 
 
 4. Discussion 
 Social-cognitive impairments in schizophrenia are broad and place significant burden on functional recovery ( Couture et al., 2006 ;  Green and Horan, 2010 ). Despite precedence given to the understanding and amelioration of social-cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, assessment tools for the elucidation of specific deficits in social cognition have been limited ( Green et al., 2004 ). The NIMH MATRICS committee has recently recommended the MSCEIT as the key measure of social cognition in clinical trials of cognitive enhancers for schizophrenia ( Green et al., 2005 ). Indeed, several investigations have underscored the value of utilizing the MSCEIT in clinical trials with demonstration of good psychometric properties ( Eack et al., 2010 ;  Kee et al., 2009 ;  Nuechterlein et al., 2008 ) and sensitivity to longitudinal treatment effects ( Eack et al., 2007 ). As a critical next step in the validation of this promising measure, this study examined the neurobiological correlates between MSCEIT performance and gray matter morphology in early course patients with schizophrenia. 
 Results indicated significant relationships between impaired performance on the MSCEIT and gray matter density reductions in both the left parahippocampal gyrus and the right posterior cingulate. Specifically, attenuated overall and subscale (e.g., Facilitating, Understanding, and Managing Emotions) performance was significantly associated with lower gray matter density in the left parahippocampal gyrus. In addition, attenuated performance on the subscale measures of Facilitating and Managing Emotions was significantly related to right posterior cingulate gray matter density reduction. All associations between impaired MSCEIT performance and lower gray matter density were supported with confirmatory volumetric correlations, with the exception for the right posterior cingulate and the facilitation of emotions. No relationships were observed between performance on the Perceiving Emotions subscale and gray matter morphology. 
 In healthy control individuals, regions such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, insula, cuneus, and the cingulate cortex play an important role in performance on measures of emotional intelligence ( Koven et al., 2011 ;  Takeuchi et al., 2011 ). Regarding the MSCEIT specifically in healthy controls, left insula gray matter volume has been shown to be related to overall MSCEIT performance ( Kilgore et al., 2012 ). Schizophrenia patients have deficits in similar brain regions related to impaired social cognitive functioning ( Pinkham et al., 2003 ). While our results are not entirely consistent with the above findings of global social cognition, both the parahippocampal gyrus ( Lane et al., 1997 ) and the posterior cingulate ( Maddock et al., 2003 ) have been indicated in emotional processing studies of healthy participants. Indeed, parahippocampal gyrus hyperactivation abnormalities have been shown to be related to emotional misattributions in schizophrenia when compared to controls ( Surguladze et al., 2006 ). Also, associations between hypoactivation abnormalities in the posterior cingulate and theory of mind deficits have been observed in schizophrenia ( Walter et al., 2009 ). The results from this investigation also demonstrate some consistencies (e.g., parahippocampal gyrus) with recent meta-analytic evidence from functional neuroimaging examinations of emotion processing in schizophrenia patients ( Taylor et al., 2012 ). Finally, although lateral effects are difficult to interpret in this initial investigation of the neural correlates subserving MSCEIT performance, observation of lower right posterior cingulate gray matter is consistent with findings showing emotional processing deficits are similar in schizophrenia patients and patients with right hemispheric brain damage ( Mitchell and Crow, 2005 ;  Kucharska-Pietura, 2006 ). The observation of reduced gray matter in the left parahippocampal gyrus and right posterior cingulate may represent impairments in processing of positive and negative emotional stimuli during MSCEIT performance. According to the valence model of emotional processing, regions of the right hemisphere are important for processing of negative emotion while left hemispheric regions are important for positive emotional processing ( Adolphs et al., 2001 ;  Demaree et al., 2005 ;  Shamay-Tsoory et al., 2008 ), both of which have shown impairment in patients with schizophrenia ( Gur et al., 2002 ;  Kohler et al., 2004 ;  Loughland et al., 2002 ). Taken together, these findings continue to support the validity of the MSCEIT for assessing the emotional components of social-cognitive impairments in patients with schizophrenia by demonstrating associations between impaired performance on the test and abnormalities in known emotion processing-associated brain regions. Additionally, the associations between brain morphology in social-cognitive networks and performance on the Managing Emotions subscale provide further support for the decision of the MATRICS committee to recommend this particular subscale for the assessment of social cognition in schizophrenia ( Green et al., 2005 ). 
 Although the observation of neurobiological correlates of MSCEIT performance provides additional evidence for the validity of the MSCEIT to assess social cognition in schizophrenia, a number of limitations should be considered in the interpretation of these findings. This study is characterized by a moderate sample size ( N  = 51), the absence of a matched healthy control group, and its cross-sectional nature. These limitations precluded our ability to make strong inferences about the associations between MSCEIT performance and gray matter morphology, as well as detection of smaller relations between MSCEIT performance and gray matter reductions. Also, the inclusion of early course patients may have inhibited findings of possibly more robust brain abnormalities related to poorer MSCEIT scores. Social cognitive dysfunction including emotion processing, however, has been shown to be stable from prodrome to chronic phases of the illness and is an important factor in early intervention ( Horan et al., 2011 ). Despite these limitations, these findings give important biological evidence to the MSCEIT as a valid measure of social cognition and add to the growing body of literature supporting its use in clinical trials of cognitive enhancement interventions in patients with schizophrenia ( Hogarty et al., 2004 ;  Eack et al., 2007 ;  2009 ).

 Highlights 
 
 
 
 Investigation of the neural correlates of MSCEIT performance in early schizophrenia. 
 
 
 Parahippocampal gyrus lower gray matter associated with poorer MSCEIT scores. 
 
 
 Posterior cingulate lower gray matter also related to poorer MSCEIT performance. 
 
 
 Findings support MSCEIT validity as a social-cognitive measure in schizophrenia.
