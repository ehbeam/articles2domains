However, the interpretation of these concomitant effects requires a better
understanding of dopamine’s role in attention processing. Here we test the
hypotheses that D 2 /D 3  receptors
(D 2 /D 3 R) in dorsal and ventral striatum would distinctly
regulate the activation of attention regions and that, by decreasing
D 2 /D 3 , SD would disrupt these associations. We measured
striatal D 2 /D 3 R using positron emission tomography with
[ 11 C]raclopride and brain activation to a visual attention
(VA) task using 4-Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging. Fourteen healthy men
were studied during rested wakefulness and also during SD. Increased
D 2 /D 3 R in striatum (caudate, putamen and ventral
striatum) were linearly associated with higher thalamic activation. Subjects with
higher D 2 /D 3 R in caudate relative to ventral striatum had
higher activation in superior parietal cortex and ventral precuneus, and those with
higher D 2 /D 3 R in putamen relative to ventral striatum had
higher activation in anterior cingulate. SD impaired the association between striatal
D 2 /D 3 R and VA-induced thalamic activation, which is
essential for alertness. Findings suggest a robust DAergic modulation of cortical
activation during the VA task, such that D 2 /D 3 R in dorsal
striatum counterbalanced the stimulatory influence of
D 2 /D 3 R in ventral striatum, which was not significantly
disrupted by SD. In contrast, SD disrupted thalamic activation, which did not show
counterbalanced DAergic modulation but a positive association with
D 2 /D 3 R in both dorsal and ventral striatum. The
counterbalanced dorsal versus ventral striatal DAergic modulation of VA activation
mirrors similar findings during sensorimotor processing (Tomasi  et al. ,
2015) suggesting a bidirectional influence in signaling between the dorsal caudate
and putamen and the ventral striatum. Introduction Attention allows us to focus on one aspect of information (that is, the moving ball)
while ignoring irrelevant information (that is, other moving objects in the scene),
an ability severely compromised by sleep deprivation (SD). 1  Attention engages a distributed network of brain regions for
focusing on specific stimuli or the surroundings, and for resolving conflict between
multiple cues. 2  Several neurotransmitters
are implicated in the modulation of these attention components, including
cholinergic, noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems. 3 ,  4  During the last decade,
there has been an increased interest on the role of dopamine (DA) in the modulation
of attention 5  as stimulant medications
enhance DA signaling in the human brain 6 ,  7 ,  8  and improve
attention under excessive sleepiness. 9 ,  10 Previous studies have shown that SD decreases striatal
D 2 /D 3 R availability, impairs performance and alters
brain activation during attention tasks. 11 ,
 12 ,  13 ,  14 ,  15 ,  16 ,  17  Specifically,
SD has been shown to impair performance to attention demanding cognitive tasks and to
reduce arousal and alertness. 18 ,  19 ,  20 ,  21 ,  22 ,  23 ,  24 ,  25 ,  26 ,  27 ,  28 ,  29  Concomitant with these behavioral changes, SD
increases functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals in the thalamus, which
is essential for alertness, 30  while
reducing fMRI signals in superior parietal (SPC) and prefrontal (PFC) cortices during
a visual attention (VA) task. 30 ,  31 The role of DA in the regulation of thalamic and PFC activity is well
established. 32 ,  33  For instance, D 2 /D 3  receptors
(D 2 /D 3 R) in the ventral striatum (VS) have been
associated with fMRI activation of the medial PFC during visual attention to
rewards, 34  and
D 2 /D 3 R in the dorsal striatum have been associated with
neural processing in the PFC during inhibitory control 35  and executive functioning. 36 ,  37  However, the role of DA
in the regulation of the SPC has not been investigated. Thus, while SD-related
changes in the PFC and thalamic activation 30  may have reflected the decreases in DA function during
SD, 11 ,  13  the association between the decreases in DA function and the
changes in brain activation during SD are still largely unknown. We recently showed that a balance between dorsal caudate versus VS in
D 2 /D 3 R mediated the modulation of brain activation to a
cognitive task. 38  Thus, we predicted that
fMRI signals during an attention task would show distinct linear associations with
the dorsal and ventral striatal regions such that higher
D 2 /D 3 R availability in the dorsal versus VS regions
would be associated with greater cortical activation, and that SD would disrupt these
associations. Hence, in this work, we test the linear association between
D 2 /D 3 R in the dorsal and ventral striatum and VA
activation in thalamus, SPC and PFC, which are the three critical components of the
attention networks. 2  We measured
D 2 /D 3 R using positron emission tomography (PET) and VA
activation with 4-Tesla fMRI in 14 healthy men. Subjects were scanned with PET and
fMRI twice, after one night of normal sleep (that is, under rested wakefulness (RW))
and also after one night of SD. We hypothesized that cortical activation responses
would reflect the relative availability of D 2 /D 3 R in the
dorsal (caudate, putamen) versus ventral striatum, whereas thalamic responses that
are necessary for alertness 30  would show an
association with both dorsal and ventral striatum. We further predicted that SD would
disrupt the modulation of striatal signaling in the indirect striatocortical pathway
by virtue of the downregulation of striatal D 2 /D 3  receptors
that follows SD, which we have shown is associated with a concomitant impairment in
cognitive performance. 11 Materials and methods Subjects Fourteen healthy, non-smoking, right-handed men (age 32±8 years, education:
16±2 years) participated in the study. At  α =0.05 and
80% power, this sample size allowed us to detect large effects
( r =0.6) of SD on the association between
D 2 /D 3 R and fMRI activation. The subjects were
included if they were able to understand and give informed consent, and were 18 to
50 years old. They were screened carefully with a detailed medical history as well
as physical and neurological examinations. The subjects were excluded if they had
(1) urine positive for psychotropic drugs; (2) present or past history of
dependence on alcohol or other drugs of abuse; (3) present or past history of
neurological or psychiatric disorders (including sleep disorders); (4)
cardiovascular disease or diabetes; (5) history of head trauma with loss of
consciousness for more than 30 min; (6) medical conditions that may alter
the brain function; (7) used psychoactive medications in the past month (that is,
opiate analgesics, stimulants, sedatives); (8) used prescription (non-psychiatric)
medication(s); or (9) contraindications to MRI environment (metallic
implants/claustrophobia). The study participants signed a written consent
approved by the Institutional Review Board at Brookhaven National Laboratory
before the study. The subjects were asked to keep a diary of the number of hours
slept per night for the 2-week duration of the study and this corresponded to an
average of 7±1 h per night (range, 5–8 h). SD and RW sessions All the subjects were kept overnight at the Brookhaven National Laboratory campus
before their scheduled sessions ( Figure 1a ) to ensure
that that they had a good night rest for the RW session (6.7±0.9 h
of sleep; range 5–8.5 h) or they did not sleep during the night for
the SD session (supervised by a team member). For the SD session, the total time
of sleep deprivation, computed from the subject’s wake up time on the
check-in day until the end of fMRI session, was 30–35 h. The SD and
RW sessions were scheduled 2 weeks apart. The subjects did not have food after
midnight and no caffeinated beverages were permitted during the study. PET and MRI
acquisition were done sequentially on the same day, either after RW or SD. On the
RW day, the subjects were awakened at 0700 h and brought to the imaging
suite. A nurse remained with the subjects to ensure they stayed awake throughout
the study. The PET sessions (RW and SD) took place between 1100 h and
1400 h and the MRI sessions (RW and SD) took place between 1500 h
and 1700 h. Half the studies started with the RW session; the remaining
studies started with the SD session to control for practice effects on brain
activation. 39 PET imaging A Siemens HR+ tomograph with 4.5 mm isotropic resolution was used to
collect dynamic PET images in three-dimensional mode. Twenty emission scans were
obtained from the time of injection up to 54 min immediately after
injection of [ 11 C]raclopride (4–8 mCi; specific
activity 0.5–1.5 Ci μ m −1 ).
Arterial sampling was used to quantify total carbon-11 and unchanged
[ 11 C]raclopride in plasma. The distribution volume (DV)
was computed for each imaging voxel using a graphical analysis technique for
reversible systems. 40  These images were
then spatially normalized to the stereotactic space of the Montreal Neurological
Institute using a 12-parameter affine transformation. A custom Montreal
Neurological Institute template, which was previously developed using DV images
acquired with [ 11 C]raclopride and the same PET scanning
sequence 41  was used for the
spatial normalization of the DV images. The intensity of the DV images was
normalized to that in the cerebellum (left and right regions of interest) to
quantify the non-displaceable binding potential (BP ND ) in each voxel.
BP ND  images were spatially smoothed (8-mm isotropic Gaussian kernel)
using the statistical parametric mapping package SPM8 (Wellcome Trust Centre for
Neuroimaging, London, UK). Anatomical region of interest analyses In-house software written in IDL (Exelis Visual Information Solutions, Boulder,
CO, USA) and the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas 42  were used to define three bilateral
anatomical regions of interest (ROIs): putamen (PU), caudate (CD) and VS ( Figure 1a ). The CD ROI included all voxels in dorsal
caudate, as defined in the AAL atlas planes
−6 mm< z <14 mm. The VS ROI encompassed the
inferior planes of pre-commissural caudate and putamen
(6 mm< y ⩽27 mm;
−11 mm< z ⩽−6 mm) in the AAL atlas.
Average BP ND  values were computed for each subject independently for
these ROIs. We chose to report the average BPND values in the whole anatomy of the
striatal regions to minimize human errors or potential confounds resulting from
the utilization of arbitrary thresholds. VA paradigm After the PET session, the subjects underwent fMRI with a VA task that was
described previously. 39 ,  43 ,  44 ,  45 ,  46  This fMRI task was
used previously to assess visual attention activation in healthy
controls, 39 ,  44 ,  47 ,  48 ,  49  human
immunodeficiency virus patients, 45 ,  50 ,  51 ,  52  marijuana 53  and cocaine 46 ,
 54  abusers as well as to assess the
effects of functional connectivity, 54 ,
 55  sleep deprivation, 30  dopamine transporters 56  and stimulants 57  on VA activation. The ball-tracking task activates
attention-related brain regions (prefrontal, parietal, and occipital cortices,
thalamus, and cerebellum). The blocked VA task had 3 difficulty levels (2-, 3, and
4-ball tracking). Each of the three fMRI runs lasted 6 min and was composed
by three ‘TRACK’ epochs interleaved with three ‘DO NOT
TRACK’ epochs. ‘TRACK’ epochs interleave five tracking and five
respond periods ( Figure 1b ). In these epochs, a target
set of balls (2, 3 or 4 out of 10 balls) is briefly highlighted. Then all the
balls start to move. The subjects’ task is to fixate on the center cross and
track the target balls as they move randomly (simulated Brownian motion) across
the display with instantaneous angular speed of 3° per second. At the end of
tracking periods, the balls stop moving and a new set of balls is highlighted; the
subjects’ are instructed to press a button if the highlighted balls are the
target set. After a 0.5-s delay, the original target balls are re-highlighted to
re-focus the subjects’ attention on the target balls. ‘DO NOT
TRACK’ epochs are composed of five consecutive ‘resting’
periods. In these epochs, all the 10 balls move and stop in the same manner as
during ‘TRACK’ epochs; however, no balls are highlighted, and subjects
are instructed to not track the balls and view them passively. The subjects
performed a brief training session (~10 min) of a shortened version of the
paradigm outside of the scanner to ensure that they understood and were able to
perform the tasks. There were three fMRI runs (two-, three- and four-ball
tracking). Each one of these runs had 231 image volumes (4 dummy volumes, 7
fixation cross baseline volumes, 112 passive-viewing volumes and 112 ball-tracking
volumes). Different versions of the two-, three- and four-ball-tracking tasks were used in
each session (SD and RW). The stimuli were created using Matlab (MathWorks,
Natick, MA, USA) and presented to the subjects on MRI-compatible goggles
(Resonance Technology, Northridge, CA, USA) connected to a personal computer. The
display software was synchronized with the MRI acquisition using a trigger pulse.
All button press events were recorded to determine RT and performance accuracy
during fMRI. MRI data acquisition The blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast was used to assess fMRI
activation in a 4-Tesla whole-body Varian/Siemens MRI scanner. A
T2*-weighted single-shot gradient-echo planar imaging sequence
(TE/TR=20/1600 ms, 4 mm slice thickness, 1 mm
gap, 35 coronal slices, 3.1 mm in-plane resolution, 64 × 64 matrix
size, 90°-flip angle, 231 time points, bandwidth: 200.00 kHz) covering
the whole brain was used for this purpose. Padding was used to minimize motion.
Task performance and subject motion were determined immediately after each fMRI
trial. 58  Anatomical images were
collected using T2-weighted hyperecho
(TE/TR=42/10 000 ms, echo train length=16, 256
× 256 matrix size, 30 coronal slices, 0.86 × 0.86 mm in-plane
resolution, 5 mm thickness, 1 mm gap, 2-min scan time) and
T1-weighted three-dimensional MDEFT (TE/TR=7/15ms, 0.94 ×
0.94 × 1 mm spatial resolution, axial orientation, 256 readout and
192 × 96 phase-encoding steps, 16-min scan time) sequences. These structural
MRI scans were reviewed to rule out gross morphological abnormalities in the
brain. Data processing The first four volumes in the time series were discarded to avoid non-equilibrium
effects in the fMRI signal. Subsequent analyses were performed with SPM8. Spatial
realignment was performed with a fourth degree B-spline function without weighting
and without warping; head motion was less than 2-mm translations and 2°
rotations for all scans. Spatial normalization to the stereotactic space of the
Montreal Neurological Institute was performed using a 12-parameter affine
transformation with medium regularization, 16-nonlinear iterations, 3 × 3
× 3 mm 3  voxel size and the standard SPM8 EPI template.
Spatial smoothing was carried out using an 8-mm (full width at half maximum)
Gaussian kernel. A general linear model 59  was used to calculate the BOLD contrasts for each VA load
condition (two, three and four balls), session (RW and SD) and subject. The
blocked analysis was based on a box-car design defined by the onsets of the
‘TRACK’ epochs, convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response
function, as a low-pass filter, and a high-pass filter (256 s time
cutoff). Statistical analyses Simple (SLR) and multiple (MLR) linear regression analyses were used to assess the
association between the fMRI signals in the brain and the
D 2 /D 3 R measures across subjects, using VA load and
session as covariates in SPM8. Five SLR models were used with regressors that
reflected the absolute BP ND  values extracted from CD (SLR1), PU (SLR2)
and VS (SLR3), as well as the relative BP ND  measures CD/VS (SLR4)
and PU/VS (SLR5). Two different MLR models were used to study the combined
influence of receptors in VS and in CD (MLR1), as well as that of receptors in PU
and VS (MLR2). Specifically, the fMRI responses at a given voxel, S( x, y,
z ), were modeled using the affine transformation: 
 
 where  i  and  j  are CD and VS, or PU and VS, the scalar maps
 α  ( x, y, z ) are the slopes that quantify the efficiency
of the linear association between D 2 /D 3 R and brain
activation and  ε  is the intercept of the MLR. Independent MLR
analyses were carried for RW and SD as well as for the combined RW and SD sample.
For all analyses, statistical significance was set as
 P FWE <0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons in the whole
brain with the random field theory and a family-wise error correction at the
cluster level. A cluster-forming threshold  P< 0.001 (two-sided) and a
minimum cluster size of 100 voxels were used for this purpose. Results Behavior The fMRI and behavioral data in this work were previously reported in a study that
documented SD-related decreases in VA performance and fMRI activation differences
between RW and SD. 30  Briefly, subjects
reported higher sleepiness before the SD session than before the RW session (RW:
3.8±0.5; s.d.: 8.8±0.4;  P< 0.0001, paired
 t -test). Increased sleepiness correlated linearly with performance
accuracy during the fMRI tasks ( R =0.59;  P= 0.025).
Performance accuracy during fMRI decreased with increased task difficulty (from
two balls to four balls;  P< 0.0001; two-way ANOVA) and was lower during
the SD session than during the RW session ( P= 0.02). Reaction time
(RT) during the fMRI did not differ significantly across tasks or sessions. There
were no statistically significant load × session interaction effects on
subject’s performance (accuracy or RT). In the present study, we studied the
association between brain activation during the VA task and
D 2 /D 3 R measures in the dorsal and ventral
striatum. D 2 /D 3 R The average BP ND  values, which were computed without BP ND 
thresholds over the anatomical volumes of CD, PU and VS (see the
'Methods' section), were lower for SD than for RW for all striatal ROIs
(VS: 1.21±0.03 (RW) and 1.16±0.02 (s.d.); CD: 1.35±0.03 (RW)
and 1.29±0.02 (s.d.); PU: 1.72±0.03 (RW) and 1.65±0.02
(s.d.); mean±s.e.;  P< 0.05, two-sided paired  t -test,
df=13;  Figure 2 ). The BP ND  ROI
measures showed high correlations across subjects and were higher during RW than
during s.d. ( P< 0.05). The differences in the ‘relative’
BP ND  measures between RW and s.d. were not significant (CD/VS:
1.11±0.01 (RW) and 1.11±0.01 (s.d.); PU/VS: 1.42±0.01
(RW) and 1.42±0.01 (s.d.);  P >0.2, two-sided paired
 t -test, df=13). D 2 /D 3 R and brain activation The SLR analysis revealed that fMRI signals in the thalamus increased linearly
with D 2 /D 3 R across subjects during RW but not during SD,
independently for CD, VS and PU ( P FWE <0.003;  Figure 3b  and  Table 1 ). The
slopes of the linear associations between fMRI signals in the anterior thalamus
and D 2 /D 3 R in the CD, and between fMRI signals in the
posterior thalamus and D 2 /D 3 R in the VS were
significantly steeper for RW than for SD ( P FWE <0.02;
 Figure 3c  and  Table 1 ).
During RW, higher availability of D 2 /D 3 R in the VS were
associated with increased activation in precuneus and increased deactivation in
cuneus; during SD only the fMRI signals in precuneus showed a linear association
with D 2 /D 3 R in VS ( P FWE <0.001;
 Figure 3b  and  Table 1 ).
 Figure 3d  exemplifies the linear associations
between D 2 /D 3 R measures in the striatum and fMRI signals
in the thalamus, precuneus and cuneus, independently for RW and for SD. Balanced influence of D2/D3R in dorsal versus ventral striatum on fMRI
signals The SLR analysis also revealed significant linear associations between the
‘relative’ CD-to-VS ratio of D 2 /D 3 R measures
and the fMRI signals in SPC (positive slope), regions that showed prominent brain
activation to the VA task during RW but attenuated activation during SD ( Table 2 ), and in precuneus (negative slope), a region that
showed significant fMRI deactivation (negative BOLD signals) during the VA tasks,
independently for RW and for SD ( P FWE <0.03, cluster
corrected for multiple comparisons in the whole brain;  Figure
4  and  Table 2 ). The MLR analysis showed a bilinear association between brain activation responses
in parietal cortex and D 2 /D 3 R in VS and in CD ( Figure 5a ). Specifically, in precuneus, the fMRI responses
predicted by D 2 /D 3 R in VS showed a positive correlation
with BP ND VS , whereas those predicted by
D 2 /D 3 R in CD showed a negative correlation with
BP ND CD  ( P FWE <0.0005, cluster
corrected for multiple comparisons in the whole brain; RW and SD conjunction
contrast), and the MLR slope was significantly steeper for VS than for CD
( α VS > α CD ,
 P FWE <0.0005;  Figure 5b ).
Conversely, the predicted responses in SPC showed negative correlation with
BP ND VS  and positive correlation with
BP ND CD  ( P FWE <0.0005), and the MLR
slope was significantly steeper for CD than for VS
( α CD > α VS ,
 P FWE <0.002;  Figure 5b ).
Although the SLR association between the relative CD-to-VS
D 2 /D 3 R measures and the fMRI signals accounted for
less than 22% of the variance in the fMRI data, the MLR association
accounted for more than 52% of the variance in the fMRI signal in SPC and
precuneus. However, because the BP ND CD  and
BP ND VS  regressors exhibited high correlation
( R =0.91 for RW and 0.71 for SD;  Figure
5c ), we evaluated the risk of multicollinearity in the MLR model using
the variance inflation factor, VIF=1/(1− R 2 ),
and the condition number,
 κ =| λ max / λ min |,
a standard measure reflecting the ratio between the maximum and minimum
eigenvalues,  λ , of the correlation matrix computed from
BP ND VS  and BP ND CD . Depending on
 κ  and VIF, the significance of the multicollinearity problem is
usually classified as low ( κ <30, VIF<10) or high
( κ >30, VIF>10). 60 ,
 61  In the present work, the risk of
multicollinearity for the BP ND CD  and
BP ND VS  regressors did not exceed these thresholds for any
of the sessions and was lower for SD ( κ =6 and VIF=2)
than for RW ( κ =28 and VIF=6). The fMRI responses in SMA, a PFC region that was increasingly activated by
parametric VA load increases (BOLD signal=0.52±0.07% load
effect=0.16%±0.10% mean±90% confidence
interval;  Table 2 ) and in ACC increased in proportion
to the ‘relative’ PU-to-VS ratio (PU/VS) of BP ND 
measures. Visual cortex deactivation was enhanced by VA load increases and
attenuated by SD, and decreased in proportion to the relative PU-to-VS ratio of
BP ND  measures during RW ( P FWE <0.005;  Figure 4  and  Table 2 ).
Similarly during SD, ACC activation showed a negative association with the
PU-to-VS ratio of BP ND  measures ( Table 1 ;
 P FWE <0.001). The MLR analysis confirmed the bilinear association between brain activation
responses and D 2 /D 3 R in VS and PU during RW and SD
( Figure 6a ). Specifically, in SMA, the fMRI
responses predicted by D 2 /D 3 R in VS showed a positive
linear association with BP ND VS , whereas those predicted by
D 2 /D 3 R in PU showed a negative linear association
with BP ND PU  ( P FWE <0.03; RW and SD
conjunction contrast), and the MLR slope was significantly steeper for VS than for
PU ( α VS > α PU ,
 P FWE <0.005;  Figure 6b ). In
cuneus, the fMRI responses predicted by D 2 /D 3 R in PU
showed a positive correlation with BP ND PU , whereas those
predicted by D 2 /D 3 R in VS showed a negative correlation
with BP ND VS  ( P FWE <0.001; RW and SD
conjunction contrast), and the MLR slope was significantly steeper for PU than for
VS ( α PU > α VS ,
 P FWE <0.005). The SLR association accounted for
38% of the variance in the fMRI data in SMA during RW (27% during
SD). The MLR association accounted for 52% of the variance in the fMRI
signal in SMA during RW (27% during SD). The risk of multicollinearity for
the BP ND PU  and BP ND VS  regressors was
lower for SD ( κ =2 and VIF=1) than for RW
( κ =22 and VIF=6). Sleep-deprivation effects: behavior vs brain activation Across all ball-tracking conditions, SD-related decreases in performance accuracy
were linearly associated with SD-related decreases in VA activation in the PFC
(BA=24;  R =0.52;  P< 0.0004; linear regression,
df=41). Discussion Here we demonstrate a distinct involvement of D 2 /D 3 R in the
different striatal regions in the fMRI activation of brain regions involved in the
alerting, orienting and executive components of attention 2  during the VA task. We found that
D 2 /D 3 R in dorsal striatum counterbalance
D 2 /D 3 R in ventral striatum in the modulation of
activation responses to a VA task, which corroborates our previous findings using a
sensorimotor reaction time task. 38  We also
found that the SD-related reduction in the availability of
D 2 /D 3 R in the striatum was associated with (1) decreased
strength in the linear association between thalamic activation and
D 2 /D 3 R in CD, PU and VS during SD and (2) a robust
bilinear association between the activation of frontal and parietal regions and
D 2 /D 3 R in dorsal relative to ventral striatal regions
that attenuated the effects of SD. This study also documents a counterbalanced
association between caudate versus VS D 2 /D 3 R in the
deactivation of the default-mode network during VA. Thalamus The thalamus, the gateway to the cortex, 62  is essential for alerting attention 2  and for arousal 63  and has an important role in the regulation of sleep and
wakefulness. 64  Here we show for
the first time the role of D 2 /D 3 R-mediated dopamine
signaling in the activation of the thalamus. Specifically, thalamic activation
increased in proportion to D 2 /D 3 R in the striatum during
the RW condition but not during the SD condition, when
D 2 /D 3 R availability was significantly reduced and
thalamic activation was higher than for the RW condition. As the thalamus mediates
the interaction between attention and arousal in humans 63  and is involved in the alerting component of
attention, 2 ,  65 ,  66  the increased
thalamic activation 14 ,  15 ,  16 ,  17 ,  30 ,  67  likely reflects an adaptation to compensate for reduced
DAergic signaling due to lower D 2 /D 3 R during SD.
Previous studies have documented associations between striatal
D 2 /D 3 R and cortical fMRI responses to emotion, visual
attention, decision-making and inhibitory control tasks. 34 ,  35 ,  68 ,  69 ,  70  These studies, however, did not report an association
between D 2 /D 3 R and fMRI signals in the thalamus.
Dopamine is a neuromodulator that changes the efficacy of other neurotransmitters
as a function of ongoing neuronal activity. 71  The effect of DA on neuronal firing is believed to improve
signal to noise for the detection of task-specific neuronal activation in
electrophysiological studies. 72 ,  73  Thus, by decreasing non-task-related
activity, DA stimulation increases efficiency and results in lower activation of
task-specific regions. 72  Therefore, the
higher thalamic activation for SD than for RW is consistent with decreased
efficiency due to lower DAergic signaling during SD. Alternatively it could also
reflect an increased modulation by noradrenergic signaling as SD also disrupt
noradrenergic activity. 74 SPC The SPC is essential for orienting attention 2 ,
 75  and projects to multiple cortical
and subcortical areas (including thalamus) and is engaged in cognitive operations
such as selective attention and top-down control of attention. 31 ,  76 ,  77 ,  78 ,  79 ,  80 ,  81 ,  82 ,  83 ,  84  Here we
show that the fMRI signals in SPC increased in proportion to the relative
availability of D 2 /D 3 R in CD to that in VS such that the
higher the CD-to-VS ratio of D 2 /D 3 R, the higher the
activation in SPC. The SPC, which is consistently activated by the VA
task, 39 ,  43 ,  44 ,  46 ,  48 ,  85  showed lower fMRI activation during SD than during
RW. 30  However, significant
differences between RW and SD in the linear association of SPC activation and
striatal D 2 /D 3 R were not found. Thus, the lower cortical
activation for SD than for RW commonly reported in neuroimaging
studies 14 ,  15 ,  16 ,  17 ,  30 ,  67 ,  86 ,  87 ,  88 ,  89 ,  90  likely reflects
effects of SD on other neurotransmitter systems (that is, cholinergic or
noradrenergic). The MLR findings suggest that D 2 /D 3 R in CD and VS have
distinct roles in the modulation of SPC responses during VA. Indeed, the
association between D 2 /D 3 R and fMRI signals in SPC was
significantly stronger when two regressors (BP ND VS  and
BP ND CD ;  R 2 =0.52) were used in
the MLR model, compared with one regressor
(BP ND VS /BP ND CD ;
 R 2 =0.22). This finding supports the existence of a
balanced D 2 /D 3 R modulation of cortical activation
responses from CD and VS, which is consistent with our recent findings using a
sensorimotor reaction time task in a different sample of healthy
subjects. 38  The reproducibility of
the MLR findings across the RW and SD conditions strongly supports the existence
of a balanced D 2 /D 3 R modulation between CD and VS for
the SPC activation to a VA task that is robust to the SD challenge. SMA and ACC The ACC and PFC have been implicated in the executive component of
attention 2 ,  75  and are involved in target detection and
awareness. 91  We found an
association between the relative availability of D 2 /D 3 R
in the striatum and the fMRI signals in ACC and SMA, such that increased
D 2 /D 3 R in VS proportionally increased the fMRI signal
in ACC/SMA and increased D 2 /D 3 R in PU proportionally
decreased it. These findings are consistent with the well-established role of DA
on executive function in the human brain, 92  including its role in response control. 93  DA modulation in ACC is important for
executive function, 94 ,  95  and DA modulation in SMA is important for response
inhibition and response initiation. 93 ,
 96 ,  97 
Though most studies on the DAergic modulation of executive function identify the
CD as the striatal region that mediates this effect, 98 ,  99 ,  100  others implicate the PU. 101 ,  102 ,  103  Our findings suggest that during the VA task, DA
modulates executive attention through counterbalanced
D 2 /D 3 R signaling from PU and VS. Interestingly, fMRI
activation in SMA and ACC and its association with
D 2 /D 3 R did not differ for SD and RW, providing support
for a robust and balanced DAergic modulation of executive attention. Precuneus The fMRI signals in the ventral anterior precuneus showed linear association with
the ‘relative’ availability of D 2 /D 3 R in CD
and VS such that the higher the CD-to-VS ratio of
D 2 /D 3 R, the greater the deactivation in precuneus, both
during RW and during SD. The MLR findings suggest that
D 2 /D 3 R in CD and VS mediate a balanced modulation of
deactivation in precuneus, which is reproducible across sessions and robust to the
SD challenge. This is consistent with the role of DA in the modulation of the
precuneus, 56 ,  104  a major hub in the default-mode network 105 ,  106  that
deactivates during the VA task. 47  Note
that a recent study on functional subdivisions of the precuneus revealed that
ventral anterior precuneus, but not the dorsal precuneus, is connected to the
default-mode network. 107  This major
association area has reciprocal connections with superior and inferior parietal,
prefrontal, and occipital cortices as well as subcortical regions, 108  including the thalamus. 109  The precuneus, is also involved in
alertness 110  and activates during
spatial 43 ,  47 ,  111  and
orienting 79 ,  112  attention. Because DA innervation in the parietal
cortex is scarce, 113 ,  114  the association between
D 2 /D 3 R documented here suggests indirect DA modulation
through thalamo–cortical pathways rather than a direct modulation. The
enhanced deactivation of the precuneus in subjects with higher CD-to-VS ratio of
D 2 /D 3 R could reflect regulation of CD in orienting
attention by facilitating attention processing while inhibiting the posterior
default-mode network. We have shown that SD decreases the specific binding of
[ 11 C]raclopride (measured as reduced
D 2 /D 3  receptor availability in striatum), which we
initially interpreted to reflect increased competition for binding secondary to an
increase in DA release during SD. 11 
However, a follow-up study showed that the changes in DA triggered by the
stimulant drug methylphenidate were not affected by SD, which was a finding not
consistent with SD increasing DA release. 13  Moreover this was supported by microdialysis experiments in
which we showed that SD did not increase DA release. 13  This led us to conclude that the decreases in
[ 11 C]raclopride’s specific binding reflected a
downregulation of D 2 /D 3  receptors in striatum by SD.
Though the mechanisms underlying the D 2 /D 3  receptor
downregulation by SD are unclear, we speculated that increases in adenosine
following SD mediate the internalization of D 2 /D 3 
receptors. 115 ,  116  Indeed, we subsequently showed that caffeine, which is
an adenosine antagonist led to an increase in D 2 /D 3 
receptors in striatum, presumably by interfering with adenosine-mediated
internalization of D 2 /D 3  receptors. 117  Regardless of the mechanism, what our
current findings are showing is that despite the overall reductions in striatal
D 2 /D 3  receptors with SD the
activation/deactivation in ACC, SMA, SPC and precuneus to VA is buffered by
the counterbalanced modulation of D 2 /D 3  receptor
signaling in the dorsal relative to the VS through the indirect striatocortical
pathway. Limitations The multicollinearity of the D 2 /D 3 R regressors limits
the generalizability of our approach. As the multicollinearity problem increases,
the regression model estimates become unstable and their standard errors might get
inflated. As multicollinearity is considered a potential concern only if VIF>10
or  κ >30, 60 ,  61  the MLR model for the RW condition
(VIF=6 and  κ =28) was deemed viable. Furthermore,
similar MLR patterns were observed for the SD condition that had significantly
lower multicollinearity risk (VIF<2 and  κ <6) than the RW
condition, demonstrating the reproducibility of the MLR findings. Also we ascribe
a modulatory role to D 2 /D 3 R on the activation responses
to the VA task on the basis of finding significant associations, but future
studies that vary the levels of DA signaling are needed to confirm this. We cannot
assess the influence of NA (noradrenaline) on VA activation. It is known that the
DAergic circuits interact with NAergic circuits 118  and that wakefulness-promoting medications such as
modafinil may enhance arousal in humans by activation of the NAergic locus
coeruleus. 119  Thus, the
SD-related activation changes may reflect NA changes to sustain arousal during
SD. In conclusion, our study documents a significant involvement of DA signaling
through striatal D 2 /D 3 R in the orchestration of visual
attention. SD disrupted DA’s regulation of the thalamus but not that of the
SPC and PFC. Our findings also corroborate a balanced involvement of
D 2 /D 3 R signaling in dorsal striatum (CD and PU)
versus that in VS for the regulation of brain activation in regions involved in
the VA task. We thank Lisa Muench, Colleen Shea, Joanna Fowler and Youwen Xu for radiopharmaceutical

overnight onsite before their scheduled imaging sessions to ensure that that they
had a good night rest (rested wakefulness (RW) session) or they did not sleep
during the night (sleep deprivation (SD) session). All the subjects underwent
[ 11 C]raclopride positron emission tomography (PET) to
assess D 2 /D 3 R in the striatum and 4-Tesla
blood-oxygenation-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging
(BOLD-fMRI) to map brain activation to a visual attention (VA) task during RW and
during SD. ( b ) The parametric VA task had a blocked design in which
subjects either tracked 2, 3 or 4 balls out of 10 moving balls (task epochs) or
viewed them passively (rest epochs). Figure 2 D2/D3R binding. ( a ) Average non-displaceable binding potential
(BP ND ) values reflecting D 2 /D 3 R levels
were computed in three bilateral anatomical striatal regions of interest (ROIs):
ventral striatum (VS), dorsal caudate (CD) and putamen (PU), superimposed on three
orthogonal views of the human brain. ( b ) Average BP ND  maps
across subjects for the sleep deprivation (SD) and rested wakefulness (RW)
conditions, highlighting the high availability of D 2 /D 3 R
in the striatum. ( c ) Bar plot quantifying the average BP ND 
measures in the ROIs for RW and SD and highlighting the significantly lower
availability of D 2 /D 3 R for SD than for RW

right-handed men. Error bars are s.e.m. Figure 3 Visual attention activation versus dopamine (DA) receptors. Statistical

association across subjects between brain activation responses and
D 2 /D 3 R separately for caudate (CD) and ventral

SLR slopes in the thalamus were significantly steeper for RW than for SD
( P FWE <0.02). ( d ) Scatter plots showing the linear
associations between D 2 /D 3 R measures in caudate (CD) and
ventral striatum (VS), and the blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signals in

cortex (SPC; red-yellow pattern) and precuneus (blue-green pattern) during visual
attention for rested wakefulness (RW) and for sleep deprivation (SD; conjunction
analysis), superimposed on three orthogonal views of the human brain. Significance
