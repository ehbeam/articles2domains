Whole-brain  trichotillomania neuroimaging studies are lacking. Aims To investigate grey and white matter abnormalities over the whole brain in  patients with trichotillomania. Method Eighteen patients with DSM–IV trichotillomania and 19 healthy  controls undertook structural magnetic resonance imaging after providing  written informed consent. Differences in grey and white matter were  investigated using computational morphometry. Results Patients with trichotillomania showed increased grey matter densities in  the left striatum, left amygdalo-hippocampal formation, and multiple  (including cingulate, supplementary motor, and frontal) cortical regions  bilaterally. Conclusions Trichotillomania was associated with structural grey matter changes in  neural circuitry implicated in habit learning, cognition and affect  regulation. These findings inform animal models of the disorder and highlight  key regions of interest for future translational research. Declaration of interest None. Funding detailed in Acknowledgements. Trichotillomania is an impulse control disorder characterised by repetitive  hair-pulling that leads to noticeable hair loss and functional impairment  (DSM–IV). 1   Unfortunately, the majority of sufferers have never been diagnosed and have  never received  treatment. 2  Peak age  at onset is 12–13 years, and hair-pulling most commonly affects the  scalp and  eyelashes/eyebrows. 2   There have been no population-wide epidemiological studies of the condition.  Based on a survey conducted in 2500 college students, lifetime prevalence has  been estimated to be  0.6–2.5%. 3   Trichotillomania has phenomenological overlap with obsessive–compulsive  disorder and Tourette syndrome, and consequently represents a candidate member  of the obsessive–compulsive  spectrum. 4   Neurobiological models of these other conditions posit dysregulation of neural  circuitry involved in habit formation and top-down inhibitory control, based  on tiers of evidence from neuroimaging and  elsewhere. 5 , 6   There have been no brain-wide structural studies of trichotillomania, which  hampers our understanding of its neurobiological profile and overlap with  other obsessive–compulsive  disorders. 5 In comparison with other related conditions where compulsivity is also a  prominent component, trichotillomania offers advantages in terms of  neuroscientific investigation. Studies of obsessive–compulsive disorder  and Tourette syndrome have often been confounded by current medications. The  lack of established treatment guidelines for trichotillomania, and lack of  public/clinician awareness, facilitates recruitment of patients who are not  medicated to avoid this confound. It is difficult to model intrusive  obsessional thoughts or complex vocal tics in animals. By contrast,  hair-pulling is a relatively specific behaviour that occurs across species and  several promising animal models exist. Mice with disruption of the   HoxB8  gene, which is involved in neuronal development, exhibit  pathological grooming  behaviour. 7  The   Hoxb8  gene is expressed in multiple brain regions, including the  striatum and cingulate cortex. Mice with genetic deletion of a postsynaptic  scaffolding protein expressed in the striatum (SAP90/PSD95-associated protein)  exhibit compulsive grooming behaviour leading to hair-loss and skin  lesions. 8 Although these translational models implicate developmental abnormalities  of the striatum and cortex in pathological hair-pulling, and neurobiological  overlap between trichotillomania and obsessive–compulsive disorder has  been suggested, there have been no whole-brain studies of the disorder with  which to validate these approaches. Extant trichotillomania neuroimaging  studies have all used region-of-interest approaches, rather than exploring  distributed abnormalities over the whole brain. Therefore, critically  implicated regions may have been overlooked. This is particularly relevant  when considering obsessive–compulsive-spectrum disorders, which are  theoretically underpinned by abnormalities in large-scale brain systems, i.e.  neurocognitive circuits, rather than lesions within a discrete  region. 9 , 10 O’Sullivan  et  al 11  reported  reduced left putamen volumes in a sample of 10 patients with trichotillomania   v . 10 healthy controls. However, these results were described by the  authors as preliminary owing to the relatively small sample size and lack of  correction for multiple comparisons. Stein  et al  found no evidence  for caudate volume abnormalities in 7 patients with trichotillomania compared  with 12 controls using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (putamen volumes were  not assessed). 12   Keuthen  et al  reported reduced cerebellar volumes in a sample of 14  patients with trichotillomania  v . 12 controls, using MRI parcellation  techniques. 13   Grachev investigated MRI abnormalities in 10 patients with trichotillomania   v . 10  controls. 14  No  significant abnormalities were detected in the initial analysis, although a  broader analysis of 48 parcellated regions (without correction for multiple  comparisons) identified reduced left inferior frontal gyrus volumes and  increased right cuneal cortex volumes. Thus, there exists inconsistent  evidence for structural abnormalities of the striatum, frontal regions and  cerebellum in trichotillomania. The aim of the present study was to objectively investigate grey and white  matter abnormalities over the whole brain in unmedicated patients with  trichotillomania. We accomplished this by using cluster-based permutation  analysis, which enabled automated, sensitive and unbiased analysis with  correction for multiple  comparisons. 15 , 16   In light of the above discussion, it was predicted that trichotillomania would  be associated with structural abnormalities of large-scale brain networks,  including the striatum and cortex. Method Participants Patients with trichotillomania were recruited via support websites, and  controls were recruited via newspaper advertisements in the UK. Prior to  enrolment, all participants undertook an extended clinical interview conducted  by a member of the study team using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric  Inventory (MINI), a well-validated screening instrument for DSM–IV Axis  I disorders. 17   Twenty people with trichotillomania and 19 healthy volunteers were enrolled  after providing written informed consent and meeting eligibility criteria. For  trichotillomania, inclusion criteria were fulfillment of DSM–IV  diagnostic criteria (as ratified by a consultant psychiatrist), no treatment  for >6 months, and no prior history of neurological conditions such as  tic-spectrum disorders and epilepsy. Further, we excluded patients with  current depression (defined as meeting MINI criteria and/or having a  Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Scale (MADRS) total score  >10) 17 , 18   and current obsessive–compulsive disorder (defined as meeting MINI  criteria and/or having a Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale total  score  >10). 17 , 19   We measured IQ using the National Adult Reading Test  (NART). 20   Trichotillomania disease severity was assessed using the Massachusetts General  Hospital (MGH) Hair pulling  Scale. 21  Controls  were included on the basis of no history of neurological or Axis I disorders.  All volunteers were deemed safe for MRI by completion of a screening  questionnaire and the study was approved by a local research ethics  committee. Neuroimaging Structural MRI scans were acquired from all participants using a 1.5 T GE  Signa system (General Electric, Milwaukee, USA) at the Department of  Radiology, Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, UK. Axial  three-dimensional (3-D) T 1 -weighted images were obtained using a  spoiled gradient recall sequence with the parameters: 124 slices of thickness  2 mm, repetition time (TR)=33 ms, echo time (TE)=3 ms, flip angle 40°,  matrix size 256 × 256 and in-plane voxel dimensions 0.94 mm 2 .  Axial dual-echo fast spin echo images were also acquired with the parameters:  40 slices of thickness 4 mm, TR=5625 ms, TE=20 ms (proton density-weighted)  and 102 ms (T 2 -weighted) with 8-echo train length, matrix size 256  × 256 and in-plane voxel dimensions 0.94 mm 2 . Structural  scans were visually inspected by a consultant radiologist independent of the  research team for clinically significant abnormalities. Images were preprocessed with tools from the FSL software package  ( www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/ ).  Non-brain tissues were first removed using an automated brain extraction  procedure (Brain Extraction  Tool). 22  The  resulting voxels were segmented using an automated tissue classification  algorithm into probabilistic maps of grey matter, white matter, cerebrospinal  fluid and ‘other’ using tissue-type segmentation and bias field  correction (FSL Automated Segmentation  Tool). 23  For each  voxel, the partial volume coefficient was calculated, which represented the  probability of that voxel belonging to each of the four tissue classes. The  resulting segmented grey and white partial volume maps were then registered  into standard space (Montreal Neurological Institute, MNI) using affine  intermodal image registration (FSL Linear Image Registration  Tool). 24 , 25   Prior to statistical inference, all segmented maps were smoothed via the  Fourier domain, by a two-dimensional (2-D) Gaussian kernel with a standard  deviation of 1.88 mm (2 voxels). Statistical analyses Between-group measurement of grey and white matter differences were  performed using permutation tests implemented in Cambridge Brain Analysis  (CAMBA) software in Linux (version 1.3.2;   www-bmu.psychiatry.cam.ac.uk/software ).  An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was fitted at each intracerebral  voxel in standard space, with global grey matter density, age and MADRS scores  as covariates. We tested the null hypothesis of no differences in brain  structure between the two groups by permutation at the level of spatially  contiguous 3-D voxel clusters, as described in detail  elsewhere. 15 , 26   This non-parametric method of analysis incorporates spatial information and is  generally more powerful than other tests, such as those informed only by data  at the single voxel  level. 26  For  between-group comparisons, we used probability thresholds for cluster testing  so that the average number of false-positive clusters expected per map was  less than one (equivalent  P 50.004), with the voxel threshold set to   P 50.05. Clusters showing significant between-group differences were  then described in terms of their peak coordinates, and the automated  anatomical labelling template image regions contained  therein. 27  An  additional permutation analysis was conducted to explore relationships between  grey/white matter densities and symptom scores in patients, again such that  the expected number of false-positive clusters per map was less than one, and  the voxel threshold was set to  P 50.05. Correlational analysis was  performed in patients between mean grey/white densities in those clusters  showing group differences and symptom scores in patients (Pearson’s   r ). Results Routine clinical screening of MRI scans identified significant structural  abnormalities in two patients, whose data were excluded from the subsequent  analysis. One patient’s scans showed a basal ganglia signal  hyperintensity; this was deemed of uncertain clinical significance and the  patient was asked to monitor for worsening of symptoms or onset of new  symptoms. The other patient’s scans showed evidence of a brainstem  event, leading to urgent clinic follow-up. Thus, the final sample size was 18  patients and 19 controls. As can be seen in   Table 1 , the two study groups  did not differ significantly in terms of age, NART IQ, male:female ratio, and  handedness. Total MADRS scores for both groups were well below threshold for  clinically significant depression; as anticipated, patients showed  significantly higher scores than healthy controls. The mean total MGH score at  the time of study participation for the patients was 15.11 (s.d.=4.54),  consistent with mild to moderate disease severity. One patient met DSM  criteria for current panic disorder and agoraphobia; the others were free from  current Axis I comorbidities according to MINI screen. The mean age of symptom  onset reported by patients was 11.89 years (s.d.=6.85).

In comparison with  the healthy volunteers, patients with trichotillomania showed grey matter  density excesses in three clusters (see   Fig. 1  and   Table 2  for anatomical details  and peak MNI coordinates). These comprised: (a) a mean density increase of 18%  in the striatum (left putamen) and limbic system (left amygdalo-hippocampal  complex); (b) a mean density increase of 23% in bilateral frontal regions  (cingulate, supplemental motor, and superior cortices); and (c) a mean density  increase of 21% in left occipital and parietal regions  ( Fig. 2 ). These results were  not dependent on entering age as a covariate, since when the analysis was  rerun without age as a covariate, the core results were still evident (i.e.  increased grey matter in the left amygdalo-hippocampal formation, bilateral  cingulate, and right middle/superior frontal cortices). There were no  significant regions of relative grey matter reductions or changes in white  matter (increases or decreases) in the patients. No clusters were found in  which density covaried significantly with symptom severity in the patients. No  significant correlations were found between mean grey matter densities and  patient disease severity scores, in those clusters identified in the  between-group analysis ( P 40.10).

Discussion The key finding of this study was that unmedicated patients with  trichotillomania exhibited abnormally increased grey matter densities compared  with matched healthy controls in the left amygdalo-hippocampal complex, left  striatum and multiple cortical regions. These distributed structural  abnormalities occurred in the absence of medication confounds and appeared to  be unrelated to disease severity.   Fig. 2 Grey matter densities in healthy controls and patients with  trichotillomania for each of the three clusters identified in the permutation  analysis. Cluster 1, left hippocampus, left amygdala, left putamen; Cluster 2,  bilateral anterior/middle cingulate, bilateral supplemental motor area,  bilateral fronto-superior cortices; Cluster 3, left superior/middle occupital  cortex, left superior/inferior parietal cortex.   Increased grey matter has also been reported in studies of focal dystonia,  Tourette syndrome and obsessive–compulsive  disorder 28 – 31   albeit not  consistently. 5  These  novel findings support the notion that trichotillomania shares some  neurobiological overlap with other putative  obsessive–compulsive-spectrum disorders, with implications for upcoming  diagnostic revisions. Peak onset of trichotillomania is at 12–13 years  of age. Adolescence is a critical time for neurodevelopment and multiple  studies have reported intense reductions of grey matter tissue in the  pubescent  period. 32 – 35   These grey matter excesses detected in patients with trichotillomania could  reflect deviation from normal developmental trajectories. Alternatively, they  may reflect neuro-plastic changes occurring through use of brain regions  involved in grooming and habit learning, there being some evidence that  increases in grey matter can occur through motor-skill  training. 36 The striatum is thought to play a critical role in habit learning and in  the chunking of automated action sequences, according to tiers of evidence  from animals and  humans. 37  Striatal  damage in rats has been shown to disrupt the ability to perform choreographed  grooming  sequences. 38  In  humans, clinical data suggest that the striatum is responsible for the gradual  incremental learning of associations typical of habit  learning. 39   Striatal involvement in trichotillomania is reminiscent of  obsessive–compulsive disorder, and supports a similar conceptualisation  emphasising the role of the basal ganglia in the development of pathological  habits. 5 , 40 Cortical regions such as the cingulate and prefrontal lobes are involved in  multiple high-level cognitive  processes. 41  The  structural abnormalities detected in these regions in trichotillomania could  mediate cognitive problems previously identified in patients, which likely  impede quality of life. In neuropsychological studies, patients with  trichotillomania showed deficits on tests of divided  attention, 42   response inhibition and working  memory. 43 , 44   The relationship between grey matter excesses and cognitive deficits in  patients with trichotillomania merits follow-up, since these neural regions  and their dependent cognitive functions represent targets for novel cognitive  enhancers. 45 The finding of amygdalo-hippocampal abnormalities was not predicted  a  priori . The amygdalo-hippocampal formation constitutes part of the limbic  system, which regulates arousal and emotional learning  processes. 46   Several studies support a causal relationship between increased or decreased  arousal and hair-pulling episodes, and between negative affect and  hair-pulling  episodes. 47 – 49   Furthermore, trichotillomania has been associated with childhood trauma and  post-traumatic stress disorder. In one survey, the majority of patients  reported physical abuse and/or emotional neglect as a trigger in  childhood. 50 Positive features of this study include the use of permutation cluster  analysis to maximise power while facilitating corrected whole-brain analysis,  and the inclusion of patients who were untreated for at least 6 months prior  to scanning. None the less, several caveats must be considered. Details of  past treatments (beyond 6 months) received by patients were not available, to  explore whether past treatment-seekers differed from non-treatment-seekers. It  remains to be seen whether the present findings generalise to other groups of  patients with trichotillomania who differ in terms of their clinical  characteristics (past treatments, disease severity, comorbidities). Another  potential limitation is that patients showed significantly higher MADRS  (dysphoric mood) scores than controls, despite being free from DSM–IV  depression. However, we controlled for this by entering MADRS scores as a  covariate into the imaging analysis. Finally, voxel-based morphometry  techniques carry potential limitations such as confounds due to choice of  smoothing kernel size and potential misalignment of brain structures during  normalisation. On the other hand, such techniques enable objective and  sensitive analysis, with stringent correction for false positives over the  whole  brain. 15 , 16 This study, using a cluster-level technique to investigate  trichotillomania, provides an objective whole-brain-based analysis that  directs researchers to areas that are abnormal in this disorder, namely  cortical regions, the amygdalo-hippocampal formation and the striatum. These  results suggest overlap with other putative  obsessive–compulsive-spectrum disorders in terms of  neurobiology. 6 , 40   The functional significance of these grey matter abnormalities requires  clarification in follow-up longitudinal studies, and in studies of unaffected  first-degree relatives (asymptomatic individuals at increased genetic risk).  The further application of translational neuroscientific techniques to the  study of trichotillomania will extend these findings and provide new insights  into its neurobiology, with implications for diagnosis and treatment of  trichotillomania and related obsessive–compulsive-spectrum  disorders.
