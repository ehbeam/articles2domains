 Learning commonly requires feedback about the consequences of one’s actions, which can drive learners to modify their behavior. Motivation may determine how sensitive an individual might be to such feedback, particularly in educational contexts where some students value academic achievement more than others. Thus, motivation for a task might influence the value placed on performance feedback and how effectively it is used to improve learning. To investigate the interplay between intrinsic motivation and feedback processing, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during feedback-based learning before and after a novel manipulation based on motivational interviewing, a technique for enhancing treatment motivation in mental health settings. Because of its role in the reinforcement learning system, the striatum is situated to play a significant role in the modulation of learning based on motivation. Consistent with this idea, motivation levels during the task were associated with sensitivity to positive versus negative feedback in the striatum. Additionally, heightened motivation following a brief motivational interview was associated with increases in feedback sensitivity in the left medial temporal lobe. Our results suggest that motivation modulates neural responses to performance-related feedback, and furthermore that changes in motivation facilitates processing in areas that support learning and memory.

 Performance-related feedback is an important part of effortful learning, as information about correct responses and errors can motivate learners to adapt their behaviors. Such feedback engages the striatum, widely regarded as a key region for processing reward-related information, even in the absence of extrinsically rewarding or punishing outcomes (e.g.,  Daniel & Pollmann, 2010 ;  Satterthwaite et al., 2012 ;  Tricomi et al., 2006 ). However, the affective experience of performance-related feedback may be more or less salient depending upon one’s motivation to successfully complete the task. For example, positive performance feedback may be more reinforcing for a student who values scholastic achievement than for one who sees academics as irrelevant to his or her goals. As a result, it is likely that striatal engagement during feedback processing would be modulated by an individual’s motivation to perform well. 
 The striatum serves a critical role in the reinforcement learning system, receiving input from midbrain dopamine neurons that convey information about unexpected rewards, and using information about rewarding consequences to learn to select adaptive behaviors ( O’Doherty, 2004 ). Feedback-related responses in the striatum are presumed to reflect the affective value of positive and negative feedback in much the same way that reward responses reflect the subjective value of extrinsic rewards such as food or money ( Satterthwaite et al., 2012 ). However, while previous research has established sensitivity to contextual influences in striatal responses to extrinsic rewards (e.g.,  Brosch et al., 2011 ;  Chein et al., 2011 ;  Delgado et al., 2008 ;  Guitart-Masip et al., 2010 ;  Nieuwenhuis et al., 2005 ), it is unclear how the learning context might influence the response of the striatum to positive and negative performance feedback. In particular, motivation to perform well on a task may increase the affective salience of performance feedback, resulting in exaggerated striatal feedback responses. 
 Stable patterns of goal pursuit, assessed by trait measures of achievement goals, have been found to influence motivation and performance in experimental and academic situations (e.g.,  Grant & Dweck, 2003 ;  Harackiewicz et al., 1997 ;  Harackiewicz et al., 1998 ). Such traits have been linked with feedback-related activation in the striatum (e.g.,  DePasque Swanson & Tricomi, 2014 ); however, the relevance of a particular goal can also vary over time based on situational factors ( Covington, 2000 ). For example, prior experimental work suggests that monetary rewards can enhance learning for boring material ( Murayama & Kuhbandner, 2011 ). It is not always feasible or desirable to motivate academic performance or health behaviors with payments or other extrinsic rewards, which can potentially undermine intrinsic motivation for the desired behavior ( Deci et al., 1999 ) or result in unintended negative long-term effects on future motivation ( Gneezy et al., 2011 ); consequently, it is important to understand the effects of task-specific motivation on learning from feedback in the absence of extrinsic rewards or punishments. We aimed to increase the value of the learning goal itself, rather than using rewards that are extrinsic to the task to increase goal pursuit. 
 Intrinsic motivation is characterized by a focus on the inherent satisfaction in performing a particular behavior for its own sake, in contrast with extrinsic motivation, in which the focus is on attaining some separable outcome ( Ryan & Deci, 2000 ). Behavioral research suggests that a sense of autonomy, or being in control of one’s choices, facilitates intrinsic motivation ( Deci & Ryan, 1987 ). Because we sought to increase our participants’ intrinsic motivation for our learning task, we required a manipulation that would support their autonomy at the same time as promoting reflection on the value of the task. Motivational interviewing is a strategy for enhancing motivation to change in substance abuse treatment and other health domains, which uses directive questioning to elicit “change talk,” or self-generated statements in favor of pursuing treatment ( Miller & Rollnick, 1991 ). In this regard, motivational interviewing supports autonomy to enhance intrinsic motivation. 
 Brief interventions based on the principles of motivational interviewing have demonstrated comparable efficacy to longer-term cognitive behavioral therapies for reducing substance abuse ( Burke et al., 2003 ), but specific techniques used within motivational interviewing have rarely been tested experimentally. One notable exception is an fMRI study that found diminished neural responses to alcohol cues following self-generated change talk in alcohol dependent subjects, suggesting that motivational interviewing can promote the inhibition of maladaptive reward responses ( Feldstein Ewing et al., 2011 ). Rather than diminishing the value of a maladaptive behavior, we aimed to use the principles of motivational interviewing to enhance motivation and performance on our learning task, by encouraging participants to generate statements about the value of the learning task. 
 The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of enhanced motivation on feedback processing during learning. To achieve this end, we performed two experiments. In the first, we tested a motivational interviewing manipulation that could increase motivation (or attenuate natural decreases in motivation) across two sessions of a learning task. In the second, we capitalized on the motivational variability within those who experienced the motivational interviewing manipulation and used fMRI to explore neural differences associated with varying motivation levels before and after the interview. In both experiments, participants completed two separate sessions of a feedback-based word association learning task. Changes in their motivation for each session were used to investigate motivational effects on learning and feedback processing. 
 
 General Methods 
 To investigate how changes in intrinsic motivation for a learning task influence performance and neural responses to performance-related feedback during learning, we administered two independent sessions of a feedback-based learning task before and after a novel motivational manipulation. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Rutgers University, and all participants gave written informed consent. 
 
 
 Materials and Procedure 
 
 Experimental task 
 Participants completed two independent sessions of a word association learning task, adapted from a previous study of feedback processing in the striatum ( Tricomi & Fiez, 2008 ; illustrated in  Figure 1 ). During this feedback-based learning task, participants learned arbitrary word pairs through trial and error. Each trial required participants to associate one main word with one of two other word choices, as in a multiple choice test with two response options. Since the words were semantically unrelated, learning was entirely dependent on the feedback that followed each response. 
 Eighty unique word pairs were learned during the first task session (BEFORE the motivational interviewing manipulation/control rest period), and eighty new pairs were learned during the second session (AFTER the manipulation/control rest period). Each session consisted of two learning phases with feedback, followed by a test phase without feedback, in which the same 80 word pairs were presented in random order, and participants chose a match for the main word. During learning phase 1, guesses as to the correct match for the top word were arbitrary, so feedback during learning phase 1 was simply informative and did not reflect personal efficacy on the task. During learning phase 2, because participants had previously been exposed to the correct word pairs, feedback reflected the accuracy of the participants’ memory in addition to providing information about the correct response. The word pairs tested BEFORE the Motivational Interviewing (MI) manipulation included only those pairs that were learned BEFORE the MI manipulation, and those tested AFTER included only the 80 new word pairs that were introduced AFTER the MI manipulation. 
 Stimulus presentation and behavioral data collection were implemented with E-Prime software (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA). Each trial during the two learning phases began with a jittered fixation point (1–6 seconds), followed by the stimulus screen with the three words displayed (4 seconds), during which participants choose one of the two response options, and concluded with the feedback screen (2 seconds) which displayed either a green checkmark (√) or a red “x.” The self-paced test phase was nearly identical to the learning phases but did not include performance feedback or jittered inter-trial intervals. We did not include jitter between the trial and the feedback screen, because delays of even a few seconds can impact learning strategies and diminish striatal responses to feedback (e.g.,  Foerde & Shohamy, 2011 ;  Maddox, Ashby, & Bohil, 2003 ). 
 Word lengths were limited to 1–2 syllables and 4–8 letters, and all words were controlled for Kucera-Francis frequency (20–650 words per million) and imagibility ratings (score of over 400 in the MRC database;  Coltheart, 1981 ). Within each trial, words were matched for length and frequency, and did not rhyme or begin with the same letter. In addition, words presented within each trial were rated with a Latent Semantic Analysis similarity matrix score below 0.2 to ensure that no preexisting semantic relationships would bias responses toward either option ( Landauer et al., 1998 ). 
 
 
 Motivational manipulation 
 Between the first (BEFORE) and second (AFTER) sessions of the learning task, participants experienced a manipulation that was based on techniques from motivational interviewing. Motivational interviewers use an “importance ruler” to initiate discussion about the importance of changing maladaptive behaviors, in which interviewees rate the importance of a particular change on a scale from 0 to 10 ( Miller & Rollnick, 1991 ). The interviewer may then ask why they did not indicate a lower number, thus prompting the respondents to generate statements favorable to changing their behavior, even if the original importance rating was low. Self-generated motivational statements such as those elicited during motivational interviewing are expected to be more beneficial to intrinsic motivation than externally provided reasons for the participant to care about the task ( Deci & Ryan, 1987 ). 
 Participants first rated their task motivation in response the question: “How important would you say it is for you to perform well on this task?” After rating their motivation on a sliding scale from 0 to 10, participants were prompted to provide at least two reasons why they gave the rating they did, rather than a lower number. The question was open-ended and therefore allowed subjects to rely on their own values to explain their answers. 
 
 
 Manipulation check 
 In a post-experiment questionnaire completed after the learning task, participants again rated the importance of performing well on the task on a scale from 0 to 10. In addition, to more directly assess whether participants felt their motivation had changed between sessions, they also completed a  motivation change rating,  in which they reported whether they felt more, less, or equally motivated during the second session of the task as compared with the first session, on a scale of 1 (“a lot less motivated”) to 5 (“a lot more motivated”). Participants were also asked to indicate at what point during the study they became bored or sleepy, on a scale from 1 (“right away”) to 7 (“never”). 
 
 
 Behavioral analysis 
 Performance on the task was defined as the percentage of trials with correct responses in each phase BEFORE and AFTER the manipulation. The word pairs presented in the second session of learning did not duplicate those presented before the manipulation; therefore, any gains in performance reflect more efficient learning of the new word associations and cannot be attributed to memory of the associations from the previous session. To test the effect of the motivational manipulation on performance, we examined within-subject changes in test accuracy (BEFORE vs AFTER) and learning phase 2 accuracy (BEFORE vs AFTER), using paired two-tailed t-tests. In addition, to explore individual differences in the effects of changing motivation on task performance,  difference scores  were calculated by subtracting the percent correct BEFORE the manipulation from the percent correct AFTER the manipulation for the learning phase 2 and test phases. We were particularly interested in the relationship between increasing task motivation and task performance, so we conducted bivariate correlations between the  motivation change rating  from the post-experiment manipulation check and the performance  difference scores  from Learning Phase 2 and Test Phase. 
 
 
 
 Methods: Experiment 1 
 We first completed a behavioral experiment to assess the effects of the motivational interviewing manipulation in relation to a control condition. Participants completed two sessions of a feedback-based word association learning task, one before and one after either a 5-minute rest period (control group) or a brief motivational interviewing manipulation (experimental group). 
 
 Participants 
 Fifty adult participants were recruited from undergraduate courses offered by the Rutgers Newark psychology department and received course credit in exchange for their participation. Data from eight were excluded due to prior experience with the learning task (n=6) and failure to complete the entire task (n=2). Forty-two participants remained in the final sample (13 males). The experimenter randomly assigned each participant to either the experimental or control condition using a virtual coin flipper ( http://www.random.org/ ), resulting in an experimental group of 21 (10 males), who experienced a motivational interviewing manipulation to enhance their intrinsic motivation, and a control group of 21 (3 males), who experienced a quiet rest period in place of the manipulation. 
 
 Motivational Manipulation 
 Twenty-one participants completed the experimental condition, which involved the motivational interviewing manipulation described in the general methods. On a typed handout, subjects rated their task motivation in response the question: “How important would you say it is for you to perform well on this task?” After indicating their responses on a scale from 0 to 10, participants wrote down at least two reasons why they gave the rating they did, rather than a lower number. 
 
 
 Control Condition 
 The twenty-one control participants did not participate in the motivational manipulation; instead, they sat quietly for approximately five minutes between the first and second sessions of learning to ensure that the spacing between the two learning sessions was comparable to that for the experimental group. 
 
 
 
 
 Results: Experiment 1 
 
 Performance: Motivational Interviewing Group vs Control Group 
 Performance on the learning task is depicted in  Figure 2  for both groups. Across both sessions of learning, both groups exhibited performance that was at chance for Phase 1, significantly improved by Phase 2 (BEFORE MI t(20)=4.90, p<.001; BEFORE Control t(20)=4.60, p<.001; AFTER MI t(20)=6.17, p<.001; AFTER Control t(20)=5.58, p<.001), and improved further in the Test Phase (BEFORE MI t(20)=5.14, p<.001; BEFORE Control t(20)=4.95, p<.001; AFTER MI t(19)=7.06, p<.001; AFTER Control t(18)=1.69, ns/p=.107), demonstrating that all participants successfully learned from feedback during both learning phases. BEFORE the manipulation, the experimental and control groups exhibited highly similar patterns of task performance. AFTER the manipulation, the groups performed similarly in the two learning phases and diverged somewhat in the test phase, although between-group difference in test phase performance was not statistically significant,  t (40)=1.72,  p =.094. Notably, Test Phase performance was significantly greater AFTER the manipulation than BEFORE for the motivational interviewing group, t(20)=2.46, p=.023, but not for the control group, t(20)=.617, p=.545. 
 Two-tailed independent samples t-tests revealed that, compared to the control group, the experimental group exhibited significantly greater increases in their Test Phase scores from the BEFORE to AFTER sessions ( t (40)=2.234,  p =.031), but not in their Phase 2 scores ( t (40)=−.236,  p =.815). In other words, Test Phase performance increased more for the motivational interviewing group than the control group, but this was not the case for learning phase performance. Learning phase and Test Phase performance were highly correlated, both BEFORE,  r (40)=.54,  p  <.001, and AFTER the manipulation, r(40)=.73, p<.001, as were the Phase 2 and Test Phase  difference scores , calculated by subtracting BEFORE session performance from AFTER session performance, r(40)=.45, p=.003, so the fact that differences between groups only emerged in the test phase may suggest that motivational benefits of the manipulation enhanced persistence and promoted learning later into the session, from the second round of feedback. 
 
 
 Intrinsic Motivation: Motivational Interviewing Group vs Control Group 
 The experimental group exhibited marginal increases in their ratings on the motivational “importance rulers” from the one administered at the midpoint, after the first session, to the one administered at the end of the study, t(17)=1.80, p=.090. Because the control group did not complete an importance ruler at the midpoint of the study, we compared participants’ perception of how much their motivation changed from BEFORE to AFTER using a single question at the end of the study. These  motivation change ratings  were positively correlated with the difference between the end and mid-session importance rulers, r(16)=.58, p=.011. On average, the ratings were close to neutral in both groups, and did not differ significantly from each other, t(38)=.98, p=.336. However, the motivational interviewing group expressed ratings non-significantly above neutral, t(18)=1.57, p=.134; Cohen’s d = .74, while the control group ratings were statistically indistinguishable from neutral, t(20)=.175, p=.863, Cohen’s  d =.08. Fifty-three percent of the experimental participants expressed increases in motivation, whereas only 38% of their control group counterparts did, although this difference was not statistically significant,  X 2 (2,  N=40) =2.49, p =.288. 
 
 
 Relation of motivation to performance 
 All participants varied in the extent to which both their Phase 2 and Test Phase performance differed after the motivational interview manipulation/ rest period (% correct AFTER - % correct BEFORE), with an average Phase 2  difference score  of +4.60% (SD = 9.49%) and an average Test Phase  difference score  of +2.88% (SD = 13.75%). Most importantly, individual differences in  motivation change ratings  were significantly correlated with changes in both Learning Phase 2 ( r (40) = 0.471,  p  = 0.002) and Test performance ( r (40) = 0.574,  p  < 0.001) from BEFORE to AFTER the manipulation/rest period ( Fig. 3 ). Individuals who expressed the greatest increases in motivation also evinced greater gains in performance from the BEFORE to AFTER sessions. Thus, improved learning performance AFTER the manipulation appears to depend upon the extent to which motivation increased. 
 
 
 
 Discussion: Experiment 1 
 The administration of a motivational interviewing manipulation resulted in improvements in task performance that exceeded the training/order effect observed in the control group. The fact that these improvements were significant only at the test phase, but not during round 2 of learning, may speak to the importance of motivation in enhancing sustained effort or persistence at learning even after the first round of feedback. This notion is consistent with previous evidence showing that motivation enhances task persistence ( Dovis et al., 2012 ). In the context of the present study, it is plausible that even the less motivated participants would learn well from feedback presented upon the first round of learning but lose focus later into the task. More motivated individuals may expend greater effort in maintaining their attention and continuing to learn from the feedback even after the second presentation of the word pairs. 
 The motivational interview also yielded a somewhat higher incidence of increased motivation across the two sessions of the lengthy learning task; however, the manipulation was not equally effective across all subjects. The degree to which motivation changed varied across individuals, and increasing motivation was associated with gains in task performance. In other words, while the motivational interview did not result in a robust overall group increase in motivation, those individuals whose motivation increased the most after the interview exhibited the greatest gains in performance. These results suggested that an individual differences approach would be more appropriate for the fMRI study to explore the effects of motivation changes on feedback processing in the brain. 
 
 
 Methods: Experiment 2 
 
 Participants 
 Twenty-six right-handed adult participants (11 males) were recruited from the university community to participate in the study. One participant failed to complete the task due to illness. Twenty-five participants (10 males) remained in the final sample, which consisted of predominantly university students and staff with a broad range of demographics. All participants who completed the study received compensation of $50 for their time. 
 
 Experimental task 
 Participants completed two sessions of the Word Association Learning task described in the General Methods, using an MRI-compatible button box to make their responses on each trial. Both sessions were completed inside the MRI scanner. 
 
 
 Motivational manipulation 
 While inside the scanner, participants used a button box to rate their task motivation on a sliding scale from 0 to 10. Next, the experimenter prompted participants verbally to state at least two reasons why they gave the rating they did, rather than a lower number. The results of Experiment 1 suggested that a manipulation like this one increased motivation and task performance for some participants, and further indicated that individual differences in the extent of the elicited motivation changes were correlated with changes in task performance. Focusing on individual differences in the effects of the motivational interviewing manipulation allowed us to explore the relationship between changing motivation, feedback processing, and task performance in a sample that included participants whose motivation increased as well as those whose motivation remained stable or decreased over time. 
 
 
 fMRI analysis 
 Scanning took place at the Rutgers University Brain Imaging Center (RUBIC), with a 3 Tesla Siemens Trio scanner and 12-channel head coil. The fMRI data were preprocessed and analyzed using BrainVoyager software version 2.3.1 (Brain Innovation, Maastricht, The Netherlands). Preprocessing included motion correction, spatial smoothing (8mm, FWHM), voxelwise linear detrending, and high-pass temporal filtering of frequencies (three cycles per time course, equivalent to .007 Hz). Preprocessed data were spatially normalized to the Talairach stereotaxic space ( Talairach & Tournoux, 1988 ). 
 After preprocessing, the fMRI data were analyzed using a random-effects general linear model (GLM) to identify voxels throughout the brain that differentiated between the experimental conditions at the time of feedback presentation. The predictors of interest were modeled as events at the time of feedback onset and convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. These predictors included activation at the time of positive and negative feedback during each of the four learning phases: learning phase 1 BEFORE, learning phase 2 BEFORE, learning phase 1 AFTER, and learning phase 2 AFTER. Each trial period, beginning with the trial onset and ending at the time of the participant’s response, was included in the model as a predictor of no interest. Six motion parameters were also included in the model as predictors of no interest. Clusters of voxels identified by the GLM analysis at an uncorrected statistical threshold of p < 0.005 were subjected to a cluster threshold estimator in Brain Voyager, resulting in a corrected threshold of p < 0.05. Whole-brain contrasts were used to detect differences in brain responses to positive and negative feedback during different learning sessions. Imaging data from the self-paced test phases were not analyzed, as this phase lacked jittered inter-trial intervals and did not include feedback presentation. 
 
 
 Motivation and feedback processing 
 To identify regions in which feedback processing was modulated by motivation, a whole-brain analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed, with self-reported changes in motivation from BEFORE to AFTER as a covariate for the contrast representing the change in feedback valence sensitivity: AFTER (positive > negative) > BEFORE (positive > negative). 
 
 
 Task performance 
 To identify regions in which changes in neural processing at the time of feedback related to gains in task performance, a whole-brain ANCOVA was performed with the test phase performance  difference score  as a covariate for the same contrast of AFTER (positive > negative) > BEFORE (positive > negative). 
 
 
 Motivation and subsequent memory 
 To explore motivational effects on subsequent memory for the word pairs, a subsequent memory analysis was performed using a second GLM analysis. In this analysis we modeled the activation during the entire trial, from cue onset to feedback offset, during Learning Phase 1, with two predictors of interest: trials that were subsequently answered correctly and trials that were answered incorrectly during Learning Phase 2. To identify brain regions in which the relation between brain activity and subsequent memory were affected by motivation, an ANCOVA was performed using the motivation change rating as a covariate for the change in the strength of the subsequent memory effect from BEFORE to AFTER the manipulation, as defined by the contrast: AFTER (subsequent correct > subsequent incorrect) > BEFORE (subsequent correct > subsequent incorrect).

 Behavioral Results 
 
 Motivation ratings 
 At the time of the mid-session motivation manipulation, motivation ratings were already high as indicated on the importance ruler (M = 8.00, SD = 1.384, min =5). End ratings were similarly high (M = 8.00, SD = 1.708, min = 4), and were positively correlated with mid-session ratings ( r (23) = 0.775,  p  < 0.001). The difference between the ratings at the two timepoints was positively correlated with  motivation change ratings , r(23)=.44, p=.027. On the  motivation change rating , approximately half of participants reported increased motivation (n = 13) in contrast to eight who reported decreased motivation, with four reporting no motivation change after the manipulation. This variability in the effect of the manipulation on motivation levels allowed us to focus our analyses on individual differences in motivation. 
 
 
 Task performance 
 Figure 4a  shows the percentage of correct responses during each learning and test phase both BEFORE and AFTER the manipulation. Participants performed significantly better on Phase 2 AFTER the manipulation ( t (24) = 2.234,  p  = 0.035). Neither Phase 1 performance, which was necessarily at chance both BEFORE and AFTER the manipulation, nor Test Phase performance, which reflected accurate recall of 75.28% of the word pairs, differed significantly BEFORE versus AFTER the manipulation ( t (24) = 0.653,  p  = 0.520;  t (24) = 1.219,  p  = 0.235, respectively). In other words, the motivational manipulation affected performance mainly on learning phase 2, which represented the first opportunity for participants to demonstrate the amount they learned from the study phase. 
 Participants varied in the extent to which both their Phase 2 and Test Phase performance differed after the manipulation (% correct AFTER - % correct BEFORE), with an average Phase 2  difference score  of +4.89% (SD = 10.93%) and an average Test Phase  difference score  of +2.65% (SD = 10.87%). Most importantly, individual differences in  motivation change ratings  were significantly correlated with the change in Phase 2 performance ( r (23) = 0.601,  p  = 0.001;  Fig. 4b ) and Test performance ( r (23) = 0.435,  p  = 0.030) from BEFORE to AFTER the manipulation. Individuals who experienced the greatest increases in motivation also evinced greater gains in performance from the BEFORE to AFTER sessions. Thus, improved learning performance appears to depend upon the extent to which motivation increased after the manipulation. 
 
 
 
 fMRI Results 
 
 Feedback sensitivity 
 During both learning phases, positive feedback elicited higher activation than negative feedback in many regions that have previously been implicated in reward and feedback processing, including the bilateral ventral striatum, head of the right caudate nucleus, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), medial temporal lobes, and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC;  Fig. 5 ,  Table 1 ). Despite previous findings that the dorsal striatum is more responsive to feedback during the second phase of learning, when feedback reflects the accuracy of one’s memory ( Tricomi & Fiez, 2008 ), no areas exhibited significantly greater sensitivity to feedback valence during phase 2 compared with phase 1; however, the reverse pattern was observed in small regions within the inferior frontal gyrus (peak x, y, z = 41, 22, 6; t = 3.81, p<0.001) and medial frontal gyrus (peak x, y, z = 5, 28, 36; t = 3.47, p=0.002). 
 
 
 Changes across sessions 
 When analyzing changes in activation across sessions, we compared intra-session contrasts of positive > negative feedback to control for potential effects of time or separate scanning sessions on the BOLD signal for individual conditions. Therefore, to examine differences in feedback sensitivity BEFORE and AFTER the manipulation, we compared feedback sensitivity (positive > negative) BEFORE versus AFTER the manipulation using the contrast AFTER (positive > negative feedback) > BEFORE (positive > negative feedback). Valence sensitivity declined after the manipulation in the ventral striatum, as well as parts of the occipital cortex and cerebellum ( Fig. 6a ;  Table 2 ), which is consistent with decreases in task engagement that were reported by the subjects (see Discussion section). 
 To better understand the source of this effect, we examined the parameter estimates for positive and negative feedback separately within the ventral striatum. The decline in valence sensitivity within the ventral striatum was driven more strongly by an attenuated decrease in activation following negative feedback, which was marginally higher (less negative) AFTER the manipulation than BEFORE, t(24)=1.75, p=.093. The decrease in positive feedback activation AFTER the manipulation was not significant, t(24)=.63, p=.533; however, the more subtle decreases in positive feedback combined with nearly significant increases in negative feedback activation contributed to a significantly reduced valence sensitivity. 
 
 
 Relationship between feedback sensitivity and motivation 
 Within the ventral striatum ROI identified above, the decline in valence sensitivity was negatively correlated with the raw motivation ratings, both from the manipulation between the two learning sessions ( r (23) =0.455,  p  = 0.022;  Fig. 6b ) and at the end of the study ( r (23) = 0.426,  p  = 0.034). In other words, the most motivated subjects showed the smallest decline in valence sensitivity over the course of the experiment. This pattern suggests that more motivated subjects may maintain focus and remain responsive to feedback later during the experiment, bucking the trend of becoming less attentive due to sleepiness or boredom that often occurs later in the experiment. Because the learning task lasted for nearly 90 minutes, it was common for participants to lose focus later during the experiment, and in fact 21 out of 25 reported becoming bored or sleepy either halfway through the experiment (n=10) or between the start and end of the second experimental session (n=11). 
 The whole-brain ANCOVA using  motivation change rating  as a covariate identified regions in which BEFORE to AFTER changes in valence sensitivity correlated with changes in motivation from BEFORE to AFTER the manipulation. One region of the left medial temporal lobe exhibited a positive relationship between increasing motivation and increasing valence sensitivity, peaking in the anterior parahippocampal gyrus (peak x, y, z = −22, −20, −24; peak  r (23) = 0.692,  p  < 0.05 corrected;  Fig. 7 ). In the parahippocampal gyrus, differential activation for positive > negative feedback increased AFTER the manipulation for participants who also reported increases in motivation AFTER the manipulation. This relationship remained significant when subjected to a partial correlation to control for changes in performance from BEFORE to AFTER the manipulation: r(22)=.671, p<.001. This region has been implicated in associative learning and strength of associations during retrieval (Achim et al., 2002;  Spaniol et al., 2009 ), so this pattern of activation may reflect feedback-based strengthening of memory associations that was enhanced when motivation was high. The opposite pattern was observed in a (white-matter) cluster near the insula, in which increasing motivation was associated with diminishing sensitivity to feedback valence (peak x, y, z = 44, −17, 24, peak  r (23) = −.683,  p  < 0.05, corrected). 
 
 
 Relationship between feedback sensitivity and test phase performance 
 A whole-brain ANCOVA using the  test phase difference score  as a covariate identified bilateral posterior cingulate regions in which BEFORE to AFTER changes in valence sensitivity correlated with changes in test phase performance from BEFORE to AFTER the manipulation ( Fig. 8 ). In PCC, increases in valence sensitivity correlated with increases in test phase performance, suggesting that heightened feedback responses in PCC may contribute to learning. Additional regions, which instead demonstrated an inverse correlation between changes in test phase performance and changing valence sensitivity, are included in  Table 3 . 
 
 
 Relationship between subsequent memory & motivation 
 The ANCOVA using Motivation Change Ratings as a covariate for the change in subsequent memory effects, i.e., the contrast of AFTER (subsequently correct vs subsequently incorrect) – BEFORE (subsequently correct vs subsequently incorrect) identified clusters of activation in three regions which exhibited increasing subsequent memory effects from BEFORE to AFTER the manipulation as a function of increasing motivation: the medial frontal gyrus (BA 8, peak x, y, z = 11, 37, 19, peak  r (23)=0.572,  p  = 0.003), another in the cerebellum (tonsil, peak x, y, z = −1 −53, −42, peak  r (23)=0.676,  p  < 0.001), and a left middle area of the superior temporal sulcus (BA 21, peak x, y, z = −46, −2, −12, peak  r (23)=0.615,  p  = 0.001). 
 
 
 
 
 Discussion: Experiment 2 
 This experiment tested the relationship between neural responses to feedback during learning and the motivational value of the feedback. Performance increases after a motivational interviewing manipulation were associated with increases in motivation, suggesting that the instructive efficacy of feedback is enhanced when motivation is increased. Additionally, motivation appeared to sustain feedback processing in the striatum across the duration of the lengthy task, and increases in motivation following the manipulation were associated with heightened sensitivity to correct versus incorrect feedback trials in the left parahippocampal gyrus. Heightened feedback-related activation in the posterior cingulate cortex after the manipulation was associated with gains in test phase performance, suggesting that responses to feedback in the PCC may play a role in facilitating learning during this task. Finally, increasing motivation was associated with a stronger relationship between task-related activation during learning and subsequent memory in the medial frontal gyrus and the middle temporal gyrus. These results suggest that neural processing relating to feedback valence is dependent upon motivation to perform well on the task. 
 
 Motivational Effects on Feedback Processing 
 In the ventral striatum, differentiation between positive and negative feedback weakened after the manipulation. Participants reported that they became bored or sleepy approximately halfway through the study, and this loss of focus may have contributed to the decline in feedback sensitivity later in the experiment. However, task-specific motivation attenuated the general trend for feedback sensitivity to decline across the two sessions of the learning task, suggesting that the more motivated participants may have remained more attuned to the feedback in spite of their fatigue. The ventral striatum has been previously implicated in reward processing and learning to predict positive outcomes, so its involvement during feedback-based learning has been interpreted as evidence that positive feedback is viewed as a rewarding outcome ( Satterthwaite et al., 2012 ). Highly motivated subjects may be the most likely to replenish their declining interest and maintain their valuation of the feedback, thus explaining the modulating influence of motivation on this decline in feedback sensitivity. 
 Changes in motivation were associated with changing activation in the left medial temporal lobe. The left anterior parahippocampal gyrus exhibited increasing valence sensitivity after the manipulation for those subjects who reported increases in motivation after the motivational interview. The motivational modulation of the parahippocampal gyrus in this study is consistent with evidence that dopaminergic projections from the midbrain to the MTL communicate information about the motivational significance of information ( Shohamy & Adcock, 2010 ). The parahippocampal gyrus has been implicated in associative encoding of arbitrary pairs of objects ( Achim et al, 2007 ), emotional memory encoding ( Murty et al., 2010 ), and memory retrieval, including activation during recognition tests that is highest for items that are remembered with the highest confidence ( Spaniol et al., 2009 ). During our task, this parahippocampal region may have been involved in the learning and recall of the arbitrary word pairs. When motivation increases, participants may be more successful at remembering the correct responses with high confidence, which have been associated with greater activation in the parahippocampal gyrus. 
 
 
 Neural Processing Supporting Task Performance 
 While it is important to demonstrate that motivation can influence feedback related activation, we were also interested in exploring the networks that are involved in translating feedback into learning success. To identify brain regions that supported learning, we located performance-relevant regions where increases in feedback sensitivity AFTER the manipulation correlated with gains in test performance. The posterior cingulate cortex, which was also identified in the positive > negative feedback contrast, showed this pattern. Positive > Negative activation during learning increased the most after the manipulation for those subjects who showed the largest Test Phase performance increases. Although the PCC is considered to be a part of the default network, it has also shown sensitivity to reward prediction error during reinforcement learning ( Cohen, 2007 ), and it has anatomical connections to areas involved in reward, memory, and attention ( Pearson et al., 2011 ). Because it has been implicated in salience processing, reward value, and attentional shifts ( Leech et al., 2011 ), its sensitivity to feedback valence in our task may represent a reward or salience reaction that is translated into shifts in attention and enhanced task performance. 
 
 
 Motivational Modulation of Subsequent Memory Effects 
 In a left middle area of the superior temporal sulcus, a correlation between motivation change ratings and the change in the subsequent memory contrast indicated that in this region there is a stronger relationship between activation and subsequent memory when motivation for the task is higher. The left middle STS may have been recruited due to the role of this region in speech processing (Hein & Knight, 2002), which might be engaged when the previously learned word pairs are being recalled and/or rehearsed. This strengthening of subsequent memory effects during periods of increased motivation could indicate that motivation facilitates a stronger link between retrieval/maintenance of relevant verbal information during learning and the subsequent ability to accurately retrieve the correct word association. It is plausible that task-specific motivation would enhance processing in regions relevant to the processing of words (e.g., the STS) and the formation of associative memories (e.g., the parahippocampal gyrus) during our paired associate word learning task, since previous research has shown similar motivation-related increases in task-relevant processing in cognitive control and visual networks (e.g.,  Pessoa, 2009 ). 
 
 
 Limitations 
 Because the BEFORE and AFTER sessions of learning were spaced apart in time, it was necessary to control for a potential order effect. Experiment 1 demonstrated test phase improvements for participants who experienced the manipulation and not a behavioral control group, suggesting that performance improvements cannot merely be attributed to the prior exposure to the experimental paradigm. Additionally, to address this confound within the fMRI sample, individual conditions were not contrasted between sessions, but rather within-session contrasts (e.g., positive > negative feedback) were compared across the two sessions. Because we were not able to directly compare individual conditions, our results are limited to regions where motivation or task performance correlated with differential processing of positive versus negative feedback. This constraint makes interpretation difficult for brain areas that are not typically associated with effects of feedback valence per se, such as the MTL, STS and lateral prefrontal cortex, but was a necessary compromise to rule out global differences in signal that may occur across experimental sessions. 
 Due to lack of jitter between the feedback and stimulus screens, activation at the time of feedback may include residual activation from the trial itself. To address this concern, we included the trial period as predictor of no interest in the model; nonetheless, the results observed should not be presumed to be exclusively related to the feedback stimulus, per se, but are thought to reflect processing relating to the experience of achieving a correct versus an incorrect response. The finding of increased activation following positive relative to negative outcomes in the striatum is consistent with the neural responses to unpredictable rewards and punishments in non-learning contexts (e.g.  Delgado et al., 2000 ). 
 The motivation change ratings that we used to determine whether motivation increased from BEFORE to AFTER the motivational interview were collected at the end of the experiment. Retrospective reporting on whether motivation increased, decreased, or remained the same across the two sessions of learning may have been biased by participants’ perceptions of their performance on the task. The neural results suggest that motivation ratings reflect motivation beyond merely that bestowed by the frequency of positive feedback, since correlations between motivation and activation in the parahippocampal gyrus remained significant when controlling for changes in performance. 
 Because time constraints precluded the inclusion of confidence ratings during the feedback phases, we were not able to investigate how neural responses to positive feedback might vary as a function of whether it follows a correct guess as opposed to accurate recall. Therefore, the precise nature of what positive and negative feedback mean to the participant on any given trial is not fully clear. Because the intrinsic value of feedback may be tied to whether or not a participant feels the feedback reflects personal goal achievement as opposed to a random outcome, high-confidence responses might show even more sensitivity to differences in intrinsic motivation. This interesting question remains open for further study. 
 One additional limitation is the discrepancy between the findings in the present experiment and those from previous implementations of this task. Previous research has demonstrated that performance feedback is only differentially processed in the caudate when that it reflects successful goal attainment – not when it informs about the accuracy of arbitrary responses ( Tricomi & Fiez, 2008 ). The current experiment did not replicate this pattern, since the caudate was engaged during both the first and second learning phases. The participants in this sample may have experienced a “gambler’s fallacy,” or a belief that they had the power to choose the “correct” option during the first learning phase. Anecdotally, some participants reported that either the first or second session seemed “easier” to learn, in spite of the arbitrary nature of the word pairs. Since even the illusion of agency can result in stronger engagement of the caudate during reward processing ( Tricomi et al., 2004 ), it is possible that subtle differences either in the task instructions or the demographics of the samples may have led the current participants to feel a stronger sense of control over their performance during the first learning phase. 
 
 
 
 Conclusions 
 To best tailor educational practices to the needs of the individual, influences on learning and performance other than ability need to be considered. The present study was designed to test the notion that neural responses to feedback during learning reflect the motivational value of the feedback. We found evidence that striatal processing of performance-related feedback is modulated by intrinsic motivation, with more motivated participants maintaining a greater differentiation between positive and negative feedback during the second half of the study (after the point that the majority of subjects begin to feel bored or sleepy). Furthermore, other brain areas involved in memory and language processing, including the left medial and lateral temporal lobe, showed changes in activation that were modulated by increasing motivation. Our findings indicate that intrinsic motivation is an important factor in learning, which may help to maintain the instructive efficacy of feedback over time and strengthen the relationship between neural processing during learning and the subsequent ability to use this information when it is needed. That performance-related feedback is processed differentially depending on learners’ current motivation levels has important implications for educators and other professionals who wish to shape behavior without resorting to the use of incentives that are extrinsic to the task.

 Experimental Design. Each participant completed a BEFORE and an AFTER learning session. Each trial required subjects to learn a word pair, with two opportunities to learn each word pair (Learning Phase 1 and Learning Phase 2) followed by a test phase. Each session contained 80 unique word pairs. The test phase for each learning session probed recall for only the word pairs that were learned during that session.

Regions demonstrating sensitivity to feedback valence for both Phase 1 feedback and Phase 2 feedback included ventral striatum (VS), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and the medial temporal lobes (MTL).

 Decrease in feedback sensitivity from BEFORE to AFTER the manipulation. (A) In the ventral striatum, feedback sensitivity declined AFTER the manipulation. (B) However, throughout this region, the decline in feedback sensitivity was strongest for those reporting the lowest levels of motivation at the mid-point of the study. Those who were most motivated showed an attenuated decline in ventral striatal feedback sensitivity. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 7 
 
 Motivation increase correlates with increasing valence sensitivity in MTL. A whole-brain ANCOVA revealed a region in left MTL where increasing motivation from BEFORE to AFTER the manipulation correlated with increasing sensitivity to positive > negative feedback from BEFORE to AFTER the manipulation (both learning phases). The scatterplot uses parameter estimates extracted from the entire ROI identified in the whole-brain ANCOVA. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 8 
 
 Changes in feedback valence sensitivity in PCC correlate with changes in test phase performance. (A) A whole-brain ANCOVA identified a cluster in left PCC where increasing valence sensitivity correlated with increasing test phase accuracy. (B) Correlation between test phase difference scores and parameter estimates from the contrast AFTER (positive > negative) – BEFORE (positive > negative) in the left PCC cluster.

 Subsequent memory influenced by motivation. Within the STS, BEFORE to AFTER increases in motivation were correlated with BEFORE to AFTER increases in the subsequent memory effect.

 Highlights 
 
 
 
 We examined neural correlates of motivation changes during learning. 
 
 
 We used a brief manipulation based on motivational interviewing. 
 
 
 Individual differences in motivation changes correlated with performance changes. 
 
 
 Declines in striatal feedback responses were attenuated by motivation. 
 
 
 Motivation change correlated with changes in memory- & feedback-related activation.
