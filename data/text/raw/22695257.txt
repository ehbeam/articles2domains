 Cognitive remediation training has been shown to improve both cognitive and social-cognitive deficits in people with schizophrenia, but the mechanisms that support this behavioral improvement are largely unknown. One hypothesis is that intensive behavioral training in cognition and/or social-cognition restores the underlying neural mechanisms that support targeted skills. However, there is little research on the neural effects of cognitive remediation training. This study investigated whether a 50 hour (10-week) remediation intervention which included both cognitive and social-cognitive training would influence neural function in regions that support social-cognition. Twenty-two stable, outpatient schizophrenia participants were randomized to a treatment condition consisting of auditory-based cognitive training (AT) [Brain Fitness Program/auditory module ~60 minutes/day] plus social-cognition training (SCT) which was focused on emotion recognition [~5–15 minutes per day] or a placebo condition of non-specific computer games (CG) for an equal amount of time. Pre and post intervention assessments included an fMRI task of positive and negative facial emotion recognition, and standard behavioral assessments of cognition, emotion processing, and functional outcome. There were no significant intervention-related improvements in general cognition or functional outcome. FMRI results showed the predicted group-by-time interaction. Specifically, in comparison to CG, AT+SCT participants had a greater pre-to-post intervention increase in postcentral gyrus activity during emotion recognition of both positive and negative emotions. Furthermore, among all participants, the increase in postcentral gyrus activity predicted behavioral improvement on a standardized test of emotion processing (MSCEIT: Perceiving Emotions). Results indicate that combined cognition and social-cognition training impacts neural mechanisms that support social-cognition skills. 
 
 
 
 
 1. Introduction 
 Cognitive remediation research indicates that people with schizophrenia can improve their cognitive and social-cognitive skills after targeted behavioral training ( Wykes et al., 2011 ). Because cognitive and social-cognitive deficits are associated with poor functional outcome ( Green, 2007 ) and are not substantially improved with pharmacological treatment ( Keefe et al., 2007 ;  Swartz et al., 2007 ), cognitive remediation holds tremendous promise as a functionally beneficial treatment for schizophrenia. To maximize these benefits, it is imperative to understand how cognitive training contributes to behavioral improvement. Because cognitive and social-cognitive behavioral impairments in schizophrenia arise from abnormalities in neural circuitry ( Aleman and Kahn, 2005 ;  Barch, 2005 ), it is often assumed that cognitive training facilitates behavioral improvement through  learning-induced neuroplasticity , a process in which behavioral training induces beneficial neural changes, such as neuronal tuning and cortical expansion, that result in better cognitive processing ( Ohl and Scheich, 2005 ;  Polley et al., 2006 ). However, this assumption is rarely tested, and neural effects of cognitive remediation in schizophrenia are largely unknown. 
 The purpose of this study was to identify whether a cognitive remediation intervention which targeted both cognitive and social-cognitive skills would induce beneficial neural changes in regions that support  social-cognition . Thus far, most cognitive remediation studies have focused on cognitive skills, such as attention and memory ( Wykes et al., 2011 ). While there is no doubt that cognitive skills must be included in any comprehensive cognitive remediation intervention for schizophrenia, there is overwhelming evidence that social-cognitive skills must also be addressed. Social-cognitive skills, such as facial emotion recognition, are severely impaired in schizophrenia and significantly predict functional outcome, even after accounting for the contribution of general cognition ( Hooker and Park, 2002 ). 
 In this project, social-cognitive training and pre/post assessments focused on facial emotion recognition. This choice was motivated by several factors. First, neural regions that process facial emotion are clearly defined and dissociable from regions that process non-emotional information from visual stimuli, such as the physical properties of objects and faces. Regions involved in facial emotion recognition include the amygdala, superior temporal cortices (STC), and somatosensory-related cortices (SRC), particularly the postcentral gyrus. Among non-psychiatric individuals, these regions are more active during face emotion recognition than face identity recognition and lesions produce deficits in emotion recognition but not identity recognition ( Adolphs et al., 2000 ;  Adolphs et al., 2003 ;  Pitcher et al., 2008 ). Second, people with schizophrenia have facial emotion recognition deficits that are related to both functional outcome ( Hooker and Park, 2002 ) and neural abnormalities ( Namiki et al., 2007 ). Finally, facial emotion recognition training in people with schizophrenia leads to behavioral improvement in facial emotion recognition skills ( Kurtz and Richardson, 2011 ). 
 The combined cognitive plus social-cognitive training program used here builds on our previous research. Schizophrenia participants who completed cognitive (auditory-based) training focused on verbal learning and memory showed significant improvements in cognition but not social-cognition ( Fisher et al., 2009 ), whereas schizophrenia participants who completed auditory-based cognitive training plus social-cognitive training showed improvement in both cognition and social-cognition, including facial emotion recognition ( Sacks et al., in press ). Here, we investigate the influence of this cognitive plus social-cognitive training on neural activity during facial emotion recognition. 
 Schizophrenia participants were randomized to the treatment [auditory-based training (AT) plus social-cognitive training (SCT)] or placebo [computer-games (CG)] intervention. Participants completed an fMRI facial emotion recognition task, behavioral cognition and social-cognition tests, and assessments of functioning before and after the fifty hour computer-based intervention. Primary hypotheses were that cognitive plus social-cognitive training (AT+SCT) would result in greater activity in the amygdala, STC, and/or SRC during facial emotion recognition, and this increase in activity would predict behavioral improvement on an independent measure of emotion perception. 
 A secondary goal was to investigate intervention-related neural change for the recognition of positive emotions. Positive social signals are inherently rewarding; in healthy individuals, the ventral striatum (VS) and other reward-processing regions are active in response to positive social signals, such as direct gaze from a smiling and/or attractive person ( O’Doherty et al., 2003 ;  Spreckelmeyer et al., 2009 ). Schizophrenia is associated with behavioral deficits in the experience, expression, and recognition of positive emotions ( Cohen and Minor, 2010 ;  Cohen et al., 2011 ;  Horan et al., 2008 ;  Tsoi et al., 2008 ), as well as reduced VS activity in anticipation of monetary reward ( Juckel et al., 2006 ). Together these findings suggest that deficient neural response to positive social signals could contribute to socially relevant features of illness, such as social anhedonia and poor social initiative. However, research on this potential brain-behavior relationship is limited. Most fMRI emotion recognition studies focus on negative emotions. If positive emotions are included, it is usually only happy expressions, and the task is not designed to investigate neural correlates of positive expressions specifically. Our fMRI task included the blocked presentation of four positive (happy, dreamy, flirty, happily-surprised) and four negative (anger, disgust, fear, sad) expressions. The project’s overarching hypothesis was that neural response for all facial expressions would increase after AT+SCT. For positive expressions, we expected VS activity to increase after AT+SCT. 
 
 
 2. Methods 
 
 2.1 Participants and Assessments 
 Participants were N=22 volunteers with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (N=11 AT+SCT and N=11 CG). This study ran in parallel with our larger randomized controlled trial of cognitive training in schizophrenia (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00312962). Participants were outpatients and had no significant medication changes during the study. After procedures were explained, participants gave written informed consent and underwent baseline assessments over 4–5 weeks. 
 Diagnosis was assessed with Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders, medical records, and caretaker reports. Behavioral assessments included: Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI)( Wechsler, 1999 ) for IQ (baseline); Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Extended (PANSS-E) for symptom severity; Quality of Life Scale-Abbreviated (QLS)( Bilker et al., 2003 ) for functioning; Global Cognition computed from MATRICS-recommended measures( Nuechterlein et al., 2008 ) for cognitive performance; and Mayer-Salovey-Caruso-Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) Perceiving Emotions subscale ( Mayer et al., 2003 ) for emotion perception. In MSCEIT Perceiving Emotions, participants viewed pictures of faces, paintings, and landscapes (10 trials) and rated the extent (1–5 scale) that five designated emotions were expressed in the picture. 
 Diagnosis, PANSS-E, and QLS ratings were reached by consensus between two raters (ICC >.85). Research staff who randomized subjects did not conduct assessments; assessment staff were blind to group assignment. Inclusion criteria: schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, age 18–60 years, and primary English-speaker. Exclusion criteria: head trauma history, IQ<70, neurological or major medical illness, or substance dependence within six months. After baseline testing, participants were stratified by age, education, gender, and symptom severity and randomly assigned to AT+SCT or CG. 
 
 
 2.2 Intervention 
 
 Auditory Training (AT) 
 The AT program was developed by Posit Science Corporation ( http://www.positscience.com ) and described elsewhere ( Fisher et al., 2009 ). Briefly, the program consisted of computerized exercises designed to improve auditory and verbal information processing. Participants made progressively more difficult distinctions about auditory stimuli and speech under conditions of increasing working memory load. Exercises became more complex, requiring participants to incorporate their improvements in auditory perception into higher-level cognitive skills, such as verbal learning and memory. Difficulty level was continuously adjusted to maintain ~80% accuracy. 
 
 
 Social Cognition Training (SCT) 
 The SCT program consisted of exercises from two commercially available software packages: Subtle Expressions Training Tool (SETT) ( http://face.paulekman.com ), and MindReading ( Baron-Cohen et al., 2003 ;  Ekman, 2003 ). Training techniques were similar to AT in that exercises engaged both perceptual and executive control processes with progressive difficulty. Each training session covered 1–4 emotion(s), and focused on facial expressions. Difficulty level was monitored and set each day. Exercises directed participants’ attention to distinguishing perceptual characteristics of specific emotions (e.g. furrowed brow is characteristic of anger). Participants then identified increasingly subtle displays of that expression and distinguished that expression from others. Exercises progressively trained more sophisticated emotion processing by requiring participants to identify situations that would provoke each emotion and to match emotional expressions with accompanying emotion-congruent dialogue in “real-world” social scenes. Correct responses were rewarded with verbal feedback (from the program), pleasant sounds, and visual animations. Both basic and complex emotions were covered 1 . 
 
 
 Computer Game (CG) Placebo 
 The CG placebo was designed to control for non-specific cognitive components of AT+SCT, and all other auxiliary aspects of computer-based cognitive interventions, including staff contact and monetary payments. Participants rotated through 16 commercially available computer games according to a set schedule ( Fisher et al., 2009 ). Selected games were engaging but ‘non-specific’ (i.e. not targeting cognitive improvement). Games included visuospatial puzzles, solitaire, checkers, and similar others. 
 
 
 Intervention Details 
 AT+SCT participants completed approximately 60 minutes of AT and 5–15 minutes of SCT per day; CG participants completed approximately 60 minutes of computer games a day. The suggested schedule for both groups was 5 days/week for 10 weeks. There were no between-group differences in number of intervention hours (AT+SCT=47.27(9.1); CG=46.36(6.7), t(20)=.27, p=.79). Participants completed training in the laboratory setting or at home (N=2 AT+SCT; N=4 CG, non-significant difference) if travel was difficult. Payment was contingent on participation not performance. University of California, San Francisco and Berkeley ethical review boards approved the study. 
 
 
 
 2.3 fMRI Emotion Recognition Task 
 Participants completed a blocked-design emotion recognition task with three conditions: Recognition of Negative Emotions (anger, disgust, fear, sad); Positive Emotions (dreamy, flirty, happy, happily-surprised); and Object-color (blue, red, white, yellow). Object-color was the baseline condition rather than neutral faces or non-emotional judgments in order to avoid experimental confounds. Schizophrenia participants have abnormally high activity in emotion-processing regions to neutral faces ( Holt et al., 2006 ) and non-emotional (e.g. age) judgments of emotional faces require inhibiting emotional information, which is a deficit in schizophrenia ( Barch, 2005 ). 
 Each block contained eight, 4second trials followed by a 12second fixation-cross/rest period. On each trial, a picture appeared (face or object) with the four response options below (e.g. “anger, disgust, fear, sad” for Negative Emotion blocks). Each condition block was presented 6 times across two fMRI runs. Stimuli were from standard stimulus sets and were different than training stimuli. 
 
 
 2.4 fMRI Data Acquisition and Analysis 
 See  Supplemental Materials  for detailed description. 
 Images were acquired at 4Tesla and analyzed with SPM8. Single-subject models included three conditions: Negative Emotions; Positive Emotions; Objects. Three contrasts were created for each time-point (pre/post): Negative>Objects; Positive>Objects; Positive>Negative. These pre and post contrasts were entered into separate ANOVA models to investigate Group*Time interactions while controlling for age. Statistical threshold was p <.001 (uncorrected), cluster extent 10 voxels/80mm. If interactions occurred in hypothesized regions, multiple comparison correction was conducted within the anatomical region using Small Volume Correction (FWE, p<.05), and neural data was extracted from the cluster. This extracted data was used for correlations between neural change and behavioral change. Brain-behavior correlations used the MSCEIT because performance was independent from the task that elicited brain activity. 
 
 
 
 3. Results 
 
 3.1 Behavioral Results 
 Group(AT+SCT/CG)*Time(pre/post) interaction effects were investigated for all behavioral measures ( Table 2 ). MSCEIT Perceiving Emotions showed a significant interaction; AT+SCT improved more than CG participants. When controlling for age, the Group*Time interaction was no longer significant. Specific effects of age are not clear. CG participants had non-significantly higher scores than AT+SCT at baseline and a non-significant pre-to-post decline. This pattern may have contributed to the interaction and could reflect CG participants’ younger age. There were no intervention effects on functional status (QLS). There were no significant effects for global cognition which is inconsistent with prior reports ( Fisher et al., 2009 ) and likely due to small sample size. 
 Behavioral performance on the fMRI task showed a significant Group*Time interaction for the recognition of positive emotions; AT+SCT improved more than CG participants. There was no Group*Time interaction for negative emotions or object-color. Null results for negative emotions were surprising; however, lower accuracy suggests they were harder than positive emotions, perhaps causing greater susceptibility to distraction-related errors, which would obscure intervention-related improvements. 
 
 
 3.2 fMRI Results 
 
 Group*Time Interactions: Expected Direction 
 Results from the Group*Time analysis of Negative Emotions>Objects showed a significant interaction in the expected direction (i.e. intervention-related increase for AT+SCT versus CG) in right postcentral gyrus, a hypothesized region involved in facial emotion recognition. Results for Positive>Objects also revealed a Group*Time interaction in right postcentral gyrus. In both contrasts, the interaction remained significant after correction for multiple comparisons. 
 Results for Positive>Negative Emotions showed Group*Time interaction effects in VS, specifically globus pallidus. Interaction effects for Positive>Negative Emotions were also observed in precentral and superior frontal gyri. There were no Group*Time interactions for Negative>Positive Emotions. See  Figures 1 – 3  and  Table 4 . 
 
 
 Group*Time Interactions: Unexpected Direction 
 There was a Group*Time interaction in the unexpected direction (i.e. intervention-related decrease for AT+SCT versus CG) for Negative>Objects in gyrus rectus and medial superior frontal gyrus. There were no significant findings for Positive>Objects. 
 
 
 
 3.3 Correlation between Neural Change and Behavioral Change 
 Across all participants, change in right postcentral gyrus activity when recognizing both negative (Negative>Objects) and positive (Positive>Objects) emotions was significantly correlated with change in MSCEIT Perceiving Emotions score ( Figures 1 – 3 ,  Table 5 ). Greater increase in postcentral gyrus activity predicted greater improvement in emotion perception. 
 Additionally, across all participants, activity increase in left angular gyrus for Positive>Objects and left precentral gyrus for Positive>Negative significantly correlated with MSCEIT Perceiving Emotions improvement. 
 
 
 
 4. Discussion 
 This study examined the influence of combined cognitive (auditory-based) training plus social-cognitive training (AT+SCT) on neural mechanisms supporting emotion recognition. Compared to schizophrenia participants who completed fifty hours of computer games (CG), schizophrenia participants who completed fifty hours of AT+SCT showed improvement in both behavioral and neural measures of emotion recognition. First, fMRI results showed the predicted group by time interaction in the right postcentral gyrus, a neural region known to support facial emotion recognition ( Adolphs et al., 2000 ;  Pitcher et al., 2008 ). AT+SCT, relative to CG participants, had a greater pre-to-post intervention increase in right postcentral gyrus activity when recognizing both positive and negative facial expressions. Second, AT+SCT participants showed more behavioral improvement on MSCEIT Perceiving Emotions, a standardized test of emotion perception in faces and scenes administered outside of the scanner. Third, across all participants, the increase in right postcentral gyrus activity for both positive and negative expressions predicted behavioral improvement in MSCEIT Perceiving Emotion scores. 
 These findings suggest that AT+SCT, which includes training in emotion recognition, improved function in a neural structure necessary for emotion recognition skills. Disruption of postcentral gyrus activity, either from temporary inactivity or permanent damage, causes deficits in facial emotion recognition but not other aspects of face processing ( Adolphs et al., 2000 ;  Pitcher et al., 2008 ). Because the postcentral gyrus mediates somatosensory experience, one interpretation is that postcentral gyrus activity facilitates emotion recognition through simulation, a process in which people understand the feelings of others by generating that feeling in themselves. Although this study cannot identify whether participants used simulation, future studies could investigate this possibility. 
 Additionally, the results offer partial evidence that AT+SCT engaged reward-related processing in the ventral striatum (VS) in response to positive facial expressions. Compared to CG, AT+SCT participants had an intervention-related increase in VS activity for positive (versus negative) emotions. AT+SCT participants also showed a pre-to-post intervention increase in precentral gyrus activity for positive (versus negative) emotions, and this increase was related to behavioral improvement in MSCEIT Perceiving Emotions. These findings for positive versus negative emotions are intriguing but require further investigation, particularly because positive emotions included three complex emotions that were not specifically trained whereas negative emotions included basic emotions that were specifically trained. 
 Given these differences, it is noteworthy that intervention-related effects in the postcentral gyrus were nearly identical for positive and negative emotions relative to objects and not significantly different when positive and negative emotions were directly compared. This is consistent with research showing that postcentral gyrus activity contributes to the recognition of both positive and negative emotions and suggests that AT+SCT helped restore this function. 
 Overall, the neural changes demonstrated here provide initial evidence of learning-induced neuroplasticity in schizophrenia. The findings substantiate prior data showing that among schizophrenia participants, cognitive training in working-memory leads to an increase in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity which is associated with improved working-memory ( Edwards et al., 2010 ;  Haut et al., 2010 ;  Wexler et al., 2000 ;  Wykes et al., 2002 ). The only other study to examine neural effects of facial emotion recognition training found relatively weak results; occipital cortex and inferior frontal gyrus showed intervention-related increases during facial emotion recognition, but there were no significant changes in primary emotion recognition regions ( Habel et al., 2010 ). However, the fMRI task only included three expressions (happy, sad, neutral), which may not have been robust enough to reveal intervention-related effects. Even so, in a subsample of participants, intervention-related increase in postcentral gyrus activity correlated with behavioral improvement on the fMRI emotion recognition task, which is consistent with results presented here. 
 The current study has several limitations. First, because the design combined cognitive and social-cognitive training, it is impossible to know whether social-cognition or the combination of cognition and social-cognition training produced the results. Second, our sample size was small, mostly male, and included participants with a wide range of age, illness duration, and symptom profiles. These demographic factors could have different influences on training response, and the heterogeneity probably reduced the ability to reveal training-related improvements. For example, men, at baseline, have worse facial emotion recognition than women ( Thayer and Johnsen, 2000 ), raising the possibility that gender may influence the degree or rate of improvement from emotion recognition training. Third, objects were used as the baseline instead of face-processing conditions. Thus, the neural effects of AT+SCT might reflect enhanced processing of both non-emotional and emotional face characteristics. Fourth, social-cognition training was only 5–15 minutes per day. While this suggests that a relatively small amount of social-cognition training yields benefits, more intense training may produce larger effects and reveal neural changes in emotion-processing regions, such as the amygdala, not found here. Finally, participants were paid for their participation which could have influenced motivation and improvement ( Brefczynski-Lewis et al., 2007 ), an important consideration for the translation of cognitive training to clinical practice. 
 Despite these limitations, the collective data indicate that well-designed behavioral interventions can improve neural function and associated neurocognitive skills in schizophrenia. If confirmed, the potential therapeutic ramifications of this learning-induced neuroplasticity are far-reaching, for it suggests that individuals with schizophrenia can regain critical neurocognitive skills that are crucial for functional recovery.

 Group*Time interaction effects in the expected direction (i.e. AT+SCT have greater activity post vs. pre training) for recognition of negative emotions as compared to recognition of object color (Contrast: Negative Emotions > Objects). There was a significant interaction in right postcentral gyrus (peak voxel x,y,z coordinates: 42, −20, 44). The bar plot shows neural activity (percent signal change) for the contrast Negative Emotions > Objects for each group at each time point. The scatter plot shows the correlation between the change in neural activity (Post activity minus Pre activity) with the change in MSCEIT Perceiving Emotions score (Post score minus Pre score) across all participants.

 Group*Time interaction effects in the expected direction (i.e. AT+SCT have greater activity post vs. pre training) for recognition of positive emotions as compared to recognition of object color (Contrast: Positive Emotions > Objects):  A)  right postcentral gyrus [peak voxel x,y,z coordinates: 42, −20, 44];  B)  left angular gyrus [peak voxel x,y,z coordinates: −44, −58, 42]. For each region, the bar plot shows neural activity (percent signal change) for the contrast Positive Emotions > Objects for each group at each time point. The scatter plot shows the correlation between the change in neural activity (Post activity minus Pre activity) with the change in MSCEIT Perceiving Emotions score (Post score minus Pre score) across all participants. Note: In Fig 2B two people in AT+SCT group have zero change on MSCEIT and approximately the same level of brain activity, so the two diamond symbols are overlapping and only 10 diamonds are visible.

The bar plot shows neural activity (percent signal change) for the contrast Positive Emotions > Negative Emotions for each group at each time point. There was no significant correlation between change in ventral striatum activity and change in MSCEIT Perceiving Emotions score.  B)  Left precentral gyrus [peak voxel x,y,z coordinates: −44, 0, 24]. The bar plot shows neural activity (percent signal change) for the contrast Positive Emotions > Negative Emotions for each group at each time point. The scatter plot shows the correlation between the change in neural activity (Post activity minus Pre activity) with the change in behavioral performance (Post score minus Pre score) on the MSCEIT Perceiving Emotions score.
