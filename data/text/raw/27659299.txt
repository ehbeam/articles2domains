 Deficits in attention have been implicated in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), yet their neurobiological bases are poorly understood. In unmedicated adults with OCD (n=30) and healthy controls (n=32), we used resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) to examine functional connectivity between two neural networks associated with attentional processes: the default mode network (DMN) and the salience network (SN). We then used path analyses to examine putative relationships across three variables of interest: DMN-SN connectivity, attention, and OCD symptoms. In the OCD compared to healthy control participants, there was significantly reduced inverse connectivity between the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (amPFC) and the anterior insular cortex, regions within the DMN and SN, respectively. In OCD, reduced inverse DMN-SN connectivity was associated with both increased OCD symptom severity and decreased sustained attention. Path analyses were consistent with a potential mechanistic explanation: OCD symptoms are associated with an imbalance in DMN-SN networks that subserve attentional processes and this effect of OCD on DMN-SN connectivity is associated with decreased sustained attention. This work builds upon a growing literature suggesting that reduced inverse DMN-SN connectivity may represent a trans-diagnostic marker of attentional processes and suggests a potential mechanistic account of the relationship between OCD and attention. Reduced inverse DMN-SN connectivity may be an important target for treatment development to improve attention in individuals with OCD.

 INTRODUCTION 
 Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), characterized by intrusive thoughts and repetitive behaviors, has a lifetime prevalence of 2%–3% and confers a range of occupational and interpersonal impairments ( Koran, et al., 1996 ). Deficits in attention can accompany OCD, potentially arising as a result of the cognitive burden attributable to OCD symptoms ( Abramovitch, et al., 2013 ;  Abramovitch, et al., 2012 ). Despite the purported importance of attentional processes in OCD, the neurobiological basis of attentional deficits remains poorly understood. 
 An emerging body of literature suggests that deficits in attention, and related neuropsychiatric symptoms and disorders, may derive, in part, from abnormal interactions between neural networks ( Castellanos, et al., 2008 ;  Posner, et al., 2014b ). For example, abnormal interactions between the default mode network (DMN) and the salience network (SN), two neural circuits associated with attentional processes ( Posner, et al., 2014b ), have been linked to attentional lapses in healthy individuals ( Sonuga-Barke and Castellanos, 2007 ;  Weissman, et al., 2006 ), as well as several neuropsychiatric disorders including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)( Castellanos, et al., 2008 ;  Posner, et al., 2014b ), schizophrenia ( Whitfield-Gabrieli, et al., 2009 ), and depressive disorders ( Hamilton, et al., 2011 ). These two neural networks, the DMN (encompassing the posterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and lateral parietal lobules) and the SN (encompassing the dorsal anterior cingulate, and anterior insular cortices), are functionally distinct with regard to attentional demands: the DMN reliably deactivates during periods of focused, goal-directed attention ( Raichle and Snyder, 2007 ), whereas activity within the SN increases with the intensity of attentional demands ( Fox, et al., 2005 ;  Seeley, et al., 2007 ). 
 Resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) examines the coherence of neural activity across brain regions and can therefore index the relationship between neural activity within the DMN and the SN ( Posner, et al., in press ;  Posner, et al., 2014b ). Because neural activity within the DMN and the SN is typically inversely correlated, the two networks are termed “anticorrelated” or “inversely connected” in rs-fcMRI analyses ( Fox, et al., 2005 ). Attentional processes require that attentional resources can readily shift from focused, goal-directed activity that is mediated, in part, by the SN to internally focused cognitions (i.e., introspection) mediated by the DMN. Reduced anticorrelations, or reduced inverse connectivity, between the SN and the DMN may lead to attentional lapses as the introspective function of the DMN intrudes upon the focused, goal-directed function of the SN ( Gallo and Posner, 2016 ;  Sonuga-Barke and Castellanos, 2007 ). 
 Reduced inverse connectivity between the SN and the DMN has previously been reported in individuals with OCD. However, prior studies have included medicated subjects. This is problematic because serotonin-reuptake inhibitor medications (SSRIs, the most commonly prescribed psychotropics for OCD) have widespread effects on neural connectivity within the SN and DMN ( Posner, et al., 2013 ;  Schaefer, et al., 2014 ). Two prior studies included both medicated and unmedicated participants, separately presenting their data for unmedicated participants in their  supplemental materials .  Beucke et al. (2014)  reported increased connectivity between the dorsal medial prefrontal and anterior insular cortices, regions within the DMN and SN, respectively, in 23 unmedicated OCD participants (medication free for at least six weeks) compared to 23 healthy controls (HC). Similarly,  Stern et al (2012)  found reduced inverse connectivity between the anterior insular cortex (a region in the SN) and the dorsal medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices (regions within the DMN) in 17 unmedicated OCD (medication-free for at last six months) compared with 17 HC. Both studies had relatively small, unmedicated samples. In addition, neither study measured attentional processes in their subjects. Thus, it remains unclear whether reduced inverse DMN-SN connectivity is associated with impaired attentional processes in OCD. 
 To address these gaps in the literature, we used rs-fcMRI to study the functional connectivity between the DMN and the SN in unmedicated adults with OCD compared with healthy control participants (HCs); the OCD subjects were either treatment-naïve (n=16) or off all psychotropic medications for 32 weeks or more. We hypothesized that relative to HCs, unmedicated adults with OCD would demonstrate reduced inverse DMN-SN connectivity. We also hypothesized that reduced inverse DMN-SN connectivity would correlate with neuropsychological measures of attention, as well as with OCD symptom severity. Lastly, we used path analyses to explore potential relationships between DMN-SN connectivity, attention, and OCD symptoms. 
 
 
 METHODS 
 The Institutional Review Board of the New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI) approved the study procedures. Participants provided written, informed consent. 
 
 Participants 
 Thirty adults with OCD and 32 healthy adults, aged 18 to 51, were recruited. Participants were free of significant medical problems and current or past neurological disorders. No participants, including those with OCD, were taking psychotropic medications at the time of the MRI scan. In the OCD group, 16 participants were medication naïve; of the 14 with any prior psychotropic exposure, all were medication-free for at least 32 weeks (mean=71 weeks; range=32–182 weeks) prior to the MRI scan. 
 OCD participants fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for OCD for at least 1 year; 20 had no other current or past Axis I disorder; six had a current comorbid disorder (other anxiety disorder, n=5; other anxiety and binge eating, n=1) and 6 had a past history of MDD (including two with a current anxiety disorder;  Table 1 ). HCs had no current or past DSM-IV Axis I disorder and were group-matched to the OCD patients by age, sex, and IQ, as estimated by the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) ( Wechsler, 1999 ) ( Table I ). Neuropsychological testing, diagnostic/clinical assessment, and MRI scanning all occurred within 48 hours. 
 Diagnoses were made by clinical interview with a psychologist or psychiatrist and confirmed by a trained rater with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV ( Spitzer, et al., 1995 ). On the day of the MRI scan, OCD symptoms were assessed by a trained rater using the Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) ( Goodman, et al., 1989a ;  Goodman, et al., 1989b ). Two attentional processes, sustained attention and response inhibition, were assessed with the computerized Conner’s Continuous Performance Test II (CPT-II) ( Conners and Staff, 2000 ), based on reaction time variability and commission errors, respectively. In the CPT-II, participants are presented with a series of letters on a computer screen and are instructed to hit the spacebar on the keyboard whenever a letter is presented (“go trials”). However, participants are instructed to  not  hit the spacebar when the letter “X” is shown (“no-go trials”). Reaction time variability is calculated based on intra-subject variability in reaction times to “go trials.” Commission errors occur when a participant hits the spacebar during a “no-go” trial and omission errors occur when a participant fails to hit the spacebar during a “go” trial.” 
 
 
 Imaging Procedures 
 
 MRI Pulse Sequences 
 Images were acquired at the New York State Psychiatric Institute on a GE Signa 3T whole-body scanner. Acquisition of T1-weighted sagittal localizing images was followed by a 3D spoiled gradient recall (SPGR) image for coregistration with axial echoplanar images. Axial echoplanar images (TR=2200 msec, TE=25 msec, 90° flip angle, single excitation per image, slice thickness 3.5 mm, 24 × 24 cm field of view, 64 × 64 matrix, no skip, 140 volumes plus 4 dummy scans per run) were obtained to provide an effective resolution of 3.75 × 3.75 × 3.5 mm and whole-brain coverage. For resting-state image acquisition, participants were instructed to stay still, close their eyes, and let their minds wander freely. Two 5-minute resting-state scans were obtained for each participant. 
 
 
 Image Preprocessing 
 Standard image preprocessing was implemented using SPM8 ( http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/ ) and the conn_toolbox ( http://www.nitrc.org/projects/conn ). As previously described ( Posner, et al., 2014a ), functional images were motion- and slice-time-corrected, and then coregistered to an anatomical scan, normalized into the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, and resampled at 2 mm 3 . Finally, the images were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 6 mm 3  FWHM ( Friston, et al., 1995 ). Connectivity preprocessing procedures, based on the component-based noise-reduction approach ( Behzadi, et al., 2007 ;  Chai, et al., 2011 ), reduce the influence of blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal unrelated to neural activity. This approach limits the influence of confounds such as head motion, peripheral physiology, and other imaging artifacts. Head motion during scanning was minimal for participants with OCD and HCs and did not differ by group. We exclude runs with head motion greater than 2mm root mean square; none of the runs exceeded this criterion ( Posner, et al., 2011 ). Quantified head motion parameters are provided in the  Supplemental Material . In addition, six head motion parameter (3 translations and 3 rotations) and their derivatives were included as nuisance regressors in the subject level analyses and a temporal band-pass ﬁlter was applied (.01 Hz<f<.1 Hz). Group level analyses included peak framewise displacement ( Power, et al., 2011 ), age, gender, and IQ as nuisance regressors. 
 
 
 Seed-Based Connectivity 
 Following preprocessing, the BOLD time series was correlated voxel-by-voxel for each participant across the resting-state time series. Fisher z transformation was applied. Connectivity maps were generated using seeds from two seeds within the DMN: the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (amPFC); and two seeds within the salience network: left and right anterior insular cortex. The four seed regions are presented in the  Supplemental Figure 3 . The amPFC and PCC seeds were obtained from the CONN toolbox ( Whitfield-Gabrieli and Nieto-Castanon, 2012 ) which provides 8mm radius spheres. Seeds for the left and right anterior insular cortex were defined based on a previous study ( Fox, et al., 2005 ) and were 8mm spheres centered at MNI coordinates: −45, 5, 9 and 45, 3, 15, respectively. The DMN and SN seeds were selected because these regions are commonly used to examined these two networks ( Posner, et al., 2013 ;  Stern, et al., 2012 ). 
 
 
 
 Hypothesis Testing 
 
 Connectivity Between the Default Mode and Salience Networks 
 We generated seed-based connectivity maps for the PCC and amPFC for each participant. To assess group differences in DMN-SN connectivity, we entered the seed-based connectivity maps into second-level, random-effects factorial models with Group as the single factor with 2 levels (OCD and HCs). To test our  a priori  hypothesis of reduced inverse DMN-SN connectivity in OCD, we restricted hypothesis testing to connectivity between the two DMN seeds (PCC and amPFC) and voxels within a SN mask ( Seeley, et al., 2007 ). The SN mask is present in  Supplemental Figure 2B . Analyses of DMN-SN connectivity based on SN seeds, as well as whole-brain voxelwise analyses, are provided in the  Supplemental material . 
 
 
 
 Exploratory Analyses 
 
 Connectivity Within the Default Mode and Salience Networks 
 In addition to examining the connectivity between the DMN and the SN, we also explored OCD effects on connectivity separately within the DMN and within the SN. To examine connectivity within the DMN, we used the PCC and amPFC as seed regions and examined connectivity with voxels within a DMN mask ( Seeley, et al., 2007 ). The DMN mask is presented in  Supplemental Figure 2A . To examine connectivity within the SN, we used the left and right anterior insular cortex as seed regions and examined connectivity with voxels within the SN mask ( Seeley, et al., 2007 ). 
 
 
 Brain-behavior relationships 
 In the OCD participants, we examined associations between DMN-SN connectivity and two attentional measures (sustained attention and response inhibition) as indexed by the CPT-II. We calculated partial correlations between: (i) the attentional measures and (ii) DMN-SN connectivity, while controlling for age, IQ, and sex (variables that are commonly controlled for when examining brain-behavioral relationships ( Cha, et al., 2015 ;  Posner, et al., 2014c ). Sustained attention was indexed as CPT-II reaction time variability, one of the most reliable neuropsychological deficits reported in individuals with known deficits in sustained attention ( Epstein, et al., 2011 ;  Stuss, et al., 1989 ). Response inhibition was indexed by CPT-II commission errors, a putative neuropsychological measure of impulsivity ( Moeller, et al., 2014 ). We also explored whether DMN-SN connectivity was associated with OCD symptom severity by calculating partial correlations between: (i) Y-BOCS total score and (ii) DMN-SN connectivity while controlling for age, IQ, and sex. For these analyses of brain-behavior correlations, we restricted the analysis to the anterior insular cortex cluster for which DMN-SN connectivity was found to be atypical in OCD based on our  a priori  hypothesis testing. 
 
 
 Path analyses 
 We used path analyses to explore potential relationships across three variables of interest: DMN-SN connectivity, attention, and OCD symptoms. Specifically, we tested whether OCD symptoms are associated with increased DMN-SN connectivity, which in turn, correlate with decreased attention. Following established methods for path analysis ( Rucker, et al., 2011 ), we conducted a series of linear regression analyses. In the first linear regression, we tested whether the mediating variable, DMN-SN connectivity, is influenced by OCD symptoms. In the second linear regression, we tested whether DMN-SN connectivity influences attention, while controlling for OCD symptoms. Both CPT-II measures of attention (i.e. reaction time variability and commission errors) were explored in these path analyses. The path analyses were conducted using SPSS ( www.ibm.com/software/analytics/spss/ ) using PROCESS ( Zhao, et al., 2010 ). DMN-SN connectivity was extracted from SPM ( www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/ ). Statistical significance was determined based a 95% confidence interval (CI) derived from bias-corrected bootstrapping with 5000 samples. Age, sex, and IQ were included as covariates in all of the path linear regression models. 
 
 
 
 Multiple Statistical Comparisons 
 We controlled for multiple statistical comparisons using a voxelwise p value of 0.001 and a cluster filter of 100 contiguous voxels, thereby limiting false positive results ( Eklund, et al., 2016 ). Results were considered significant based on a false discovery rate of p fdr  < 0.05 ( Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995 ). 
 
 
 
 RESULTS 
 
 Hypothesis Testing 
 
 Connectivity between the DMN and the SN 
 In both groups, the seed-based connectivity maps generated from the amPFC and PCC showed inverse connectivity (i.e., anticorrelations) with regions within the SN including the insular and dorsal anterior cingulate cortices, bilaterally ( Figure 1 ). In the OCD compared to the HC group, there was significantly reduced inverse connectivity between the amPFC and the right anterior insular cortex ( Figures 2A ,  Table 2 ). This finding controlled for peak framewise displacement ( Power, et al., 2011 ), age, gender and IQ. The findings remained significant after excluding the six of 30 OCD participants with a current comorbid psychiatric disorder. 
 
 
 
 Exploratory Analyses 
 
 Connectivity within the DMN 
 In both groups, the seed-based connectivity maps generated from the amPFC and PCC seeds showed positive connectivity with regions within the DMN including the lateral parietal lobules, precuneus, and the hippocampus bilaterally. In the OCD compared to HCs groups, there was reduced positive connectivity between the amPFC and the right lateral parietal lobule ( Table 2 ). This voxelwise finding (p=0.002) did not meet the  a priori  stringent statistical threshold of p <0.001. 
 
 
 Connectivity within the Salience Network 
 In both groups, the seed-based connectivity maps generated from the left and right anterior insular cortex showed positive connectivity with regions within the SN, including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex bilaterally, basal ganglia, and the thalamus. No significant group differences in connectivity within the SN were detected (corrected p’s > 0.05,  Table 2 ). 
 
 
 Brain-behavior relationships 
 Compared to HC, OCD participants displayed greater reaction time variability, but this did not reach statistical significance (p=0.17,  Table I ). OCD participants also made significantly more commission errors than HC participants (p=0.006;  Table I ). Within the OCD group, neither reaction time variability nor commission errors were associated with OCD symptom severity ( p’s >0.25). However, reduced inverse DMN-SN connectivity in the right hemisphere (indexed by amPFC-right anterior insular cortex connection strength) correlated both with greater reaction time variability ( r =0.50;  p =0.015,  Figure 2 ) and with OCD symptom severity, as measured by the Y-BOCS ( r =0.56;  p =0.005,  Figure 2 ); these analyses controlled for age, sex, and IQ. These brain-behavior correlations were found in participants with OCD but not with HC (p’s>0.2). DMN-SN connectivity measures were not associated with CPT-II commission errors (p’s>0.4). Abnormal within DMN connectivity did not correlate with either CPT measure or with OCD symptom severity (p’s>0.2). 
 
 
 Path analyses 
 Path analyses were consistent with the hypothesis that OCD symptoms contribute to decreased sustained attention (i.e., increased reaction time variability) through their effects on DMN-SN connectivity ( Figure 3 ). In the first linear regression model, we found that OCD symptom severity was a significant predictor of increased DMN-SN connectivity (beta=0.02, t=3.10, p=0.005). In the second linear regression model, we found that while controlling for OCD symptom severity, DMN-SN connectivity was a significant predictor of reaction time variability (beta=68.93, t=2.76, p=0.012), but not commission errors (p>0.4). Lastly, bias corrected bootstrapping revealed that the indirect effect of OCD symptoms on reaction time variability was mediated by DMN-SN connectivity (coefficient=1.54; 95% CI=0.04–3.23,  Figure 3 ). All of the regression models in the path analyses controlled for age, sex, and IQ. 
 
 
 
 
 DISCUSSION 
 This study examined functional connectivity between the DMN and the SN in unmedicated individuals with OCD. We found that individuals with OCD have reduced inverse functional connectivity between the amPFC and the anterior insular cortex, regions within the DMN and SN, respectively. We also found that reduced inverse DMN-SN connectivity in OCD was associated both with decreased sustained attention and with increased OCD symptom severity. Based on our path analyses, we propose a mechanistic explanation: that OCD symptoms are associated with reduced inverse DMN-SN connectivity, which in turn, contributes to decreased sustained attention. 
 The amPFC and anterior insular cortex are central nodes within the DMN and SN, respectively. Our findings that the connection strength between these two regions was abnormal in unmedicated individuals with OCD are consistent with findings from two prior seed-based connectivity studies ( Beucke, et al., 2014 ;  Stern, et al., 2012 ). In the first study, reduced inverse connectivity was detected between the left and right anterior insular cortices and the amPFC in 30 individuals with OCD ( Stern, et al., 2012 ). In the second study, several seeds within the DMN were used and reduced inverse connectivity between the amPFC and bilateral insular was reported in 46 individuals with OCD ( Beucke, et al., 2014 ). Many of the OCD participants were medicated at the time of scanning in both studies: 43% ( Stern, et al., 2012 ) and 50% ( Beucke, et al., 2014 ), respectively. 
 Our findings add to this literature in important ways. First, by examining a larger sample of unmedicated individuals with OCD than those included in prior studies, our findings provide further support that reduced inverse DMN-SN connectivity in OCD is not simply a product of prior medication exposure. Excluding medication exposure as a potential confound is significant given prior research suggesting substantial effects of antidepressant medications (i.e., the medications that are often used to treat OCD) on DMN connectivity ( Posner, et al., 2013 ). Second, reduced inverse DMN-SN connectivity (amPFC–right anterior insula connection) was associated with increased OCD symptom severity, a finding that was not reported in prior studies ( Beucke, et al., 2014 ;  Stern, et al., 2012 ). Third, we found that reduced inverse DMN-SN connectivity was also associated with decreased sustained attention, as measured by reaction time variability on the CPT-II. This brain-attentional relationship was significant for sustained attention, but not response inhibition, suggesting that altered DMN-SN connectivity may affect a specific attentional process in OCD. Moreover, this is, to our knowledge, the first study to identify a direct relationship between altered DMN-SN connectivity and attention in OCD, though similar associations have been documented in other neuropsychiatric disorders, including ADHD ( Posner, et al., 2014b ), schizophrenia ( Whitfield-Gabrieli, et al., 2009 ), and depression ( Posner, et al., in press ;  Whitfield-Gabrieli and Ford, 2012 ). Though speculative, altered DMN-SN connectivity may represent a biomarker related to decreased attention that is transdiagnostic in nature, and not circumscribed to a specific psychiatric disorder. 
 That OCD symptoms (e.g., due to their cognitive burden) contribute to decreased attention has been previously hypothesized ( Abramovitch, et al., 2012 ). Our path analyses suggest a potential mechanistic explanation: OCD symptoms could potentially lead to an imbalance in DMN-SN networks that subserve attentional processes and this effect of OCD on DMN-SN connectivity then worsens a specific attentional process: sustained attention. We should note, however, that given the cross-sectional nature of our study, we cannot exclude alternative hypotheses. For example, poor attention could lead to reduced inverse DMN-SN connectivity, and thereby contribute to OCD symptoms, or reduced inverse connectivity could represent a common factor contributing to both OCD and poorer attention. Future research could empirically test these alterative hypotheses. For example, electrophysiological stimulation techniques could probe DMN-SN connectivity, while testing the subsequent effects on attention and OCD symptoms. 
 Two additional notes are important to consider in regard to our path findings. First, although participants with OCD had increased reaction time variability, this finding did not reach statistical significance ( Table I ). This is consistent with a recent meta-analysis suggesting that deficits in sustained attention in OCD have a moderate effect size ( Abramovitch, et al., 2013 ) and suggest that our trend level finding may be related to our small sample. Second, in their initial descriptions, Baron and Kenny argued that path analysis should only be conducted when a direct effect between the dependent and independent variables (DV and IV) is detected ( Baron and Kenny, 1986 ). In other words, a significant relationship between OCD and sustained attention should first be established prior to examining potential mediators of this relationship. However, path can occur regardless of whether a direct effect is statistically significant ( Hayes, 2009 ;  Posner, et al., 2016 ). This is particularly true when (a) the power to detect a direct relationship is limited, (b) several mediators may be influencing the direct relationship, and (c) the indirect relationship (i.e. from IV to mediator, and then mediator to DV) is statistically significant ( Hayes, 2009 ). In our path analysis, all three factors may be at play. 
 In addition to reduced inverse DMN-SN connectivity in OCD, we also detected altered connectivity within the DMN, albeit at a level that was below our stringent  a priori  statistical threshold. Compared to HC participants, those with OCD displayed decreased positive connectivity between the amPFC and the right lateral parietal lobule. Prior studies have similarly demonstrated altered DMN connectivity in OCD, though the specific connections found to be abnormal and the direction of abnormality (increased vs decreased connectivity) differs across these studies. For example, decreased functional connectivity between the amPFC and the PCC (both nodes within the DMN) has been reported in youth with OCD ( Fitzgerald, et al., 2010 ), and similar findings have been reported in adults with OCD ( Beucke, et al., 2014 ). However, another study used the PCC as the seed region and reported non-significant differences in PCC-amPFC connection strength in patients with OCD compared with HCs ( Jang, et al., 2010 ). In that same study, the authors report decreased connectivity between the PCC and the anterior cingulate cortex, middle frontal cortex, and putamen ( Jang, et al., 2010 ), which may suggest altered DMN-SN connectivity. Likewise, whereas we did not detect significant differences between OCD and HC participants in their within SN connectivity, others have noted altered functioning of the SN in OCD ( Stern, et al., 2011 ). These differences in findings could, at least in part, be attributable to differences in methodology (e.g., seed placement, acquisition/processing of fMRI data) and/or sampling (e.g., age of subjects, degree of comorbidity, and medication status at time of imaging). Nonetheless, the DMN may represent an important substrate in the pathophysiology of OCD, potentially underlying repetitive thoughts, a hallmark of this disorder. Follow-up research with more detailed assessments of these neurocognitive domains could test this hypothesis. 
 Several limitations of this study are important to consider. First, in addition to reduced inverse DMN-SN connectivity in OCD, we also found reduced connectivity within the DMN between the amPFC and the right lateral parietal lobule. It is thus possible the amPFC is poorly integrated with the DMN in OCD, and this is a contributing factor to altered DMN-SN connectivity. Nonetheless, DMN and SN connectivity may represent important neural substrates in OCD. Second, as is common with OCD, six of the participants with OCD had a current comordid Axis I psychiatric disorders ( Table 1 ). However, excluding these participants did not affect the findings from our hypothesis testing. Third, 14 of 30 (47%) participants in our OCD sample had prior exposure to psychotropics ( Table 1 ). Though we cannot fully exclude a confounding influence of medication exposure, controlling for prior medication exposure did not affect the findings from our hypothesis testing. Moreover, the participants with prior medication exposure were off of all psychotropics for an extended period of time (mean=71±44 weeks, range 32–182 weeks). Fourth, although this is the largest unmedicated OCD sample and prior studies have similarly reported reduced inverse DMN-SN connectivity in OCD, replication in even larger samples is nonetheless warranted. 
 
 
 Conclusion 
 We found that individuals with OCD have reduced inverse connectivity between the DMN and SN and this abnormal connectivity is associated with decreased sustained attention and OCD symptom severity. Based on path analyses, we suggest that OCD symptoms may lead to decreased sustained attention through their effect on DMN-SN connectivity. Future research might investigate the treatment implications of these findings such as the utility of DMN-SN connectivity and sustained attention as predictors of treatment response.

 Figure 1 
 
 A)  Resting-state functional connectivity maps with the seed in the medial prefrontal cortex (amPFC). In participants with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and in healthy controls (HC), the amPFC seed was positively correlated with posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a region within the default mode network, and inversely correlated with regions within the salience network including the anterior insular (aIN) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dCg) (corrected p’s<0.05). Red indicates positive connectivity; blue indicates negative, or inverse, connectivity. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 2 
 
 A)  The cluster in red depicts the region within the right anterior insular cortex (aIN) in which connectivity with the medial prefrontal cortex (amPFC) differs significantly between individuals with OCD relative to healthy controls (HC, corrected p<0.05).  B)  Bar graphs indicate the mean connection strength between the amPFC and aIN in OCD and HC participants.  C)  In the OCD participants, connection strength between the amPFC and right aIN correlated with OCD symptom severity (red squares,  r =0.56;  p =0.005) as determined by the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOC) total score, and  D)  with decreased sustained attention (blue diamonds,  r =0.50;  p =0.015), as determined by reaction time (RT) variability on the continuous performance task (CPT). 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 3 
 
 Path analysis indicated that OCD is associated with altered connectivity between the default mode network and salience network (DMN-SN connectivity), which, in turn, correlates with decreased sustained attention. In the first linear regression of this path analysis, we found that OCD symptom severity was a significant predictor of DMN-SN connectivity ( path a , beta=0.02, t=3.10, p=0.005). In the second linear regression model, we found that while controlling for OCD symptom severity, DMN-SN connectivity was a significant predictor of sustained attention ( path b , beta=68.93, t=2.76, p=0.012). Bias corrected bootstrapping found that the indirect effect of OCD symptoms on reaction time variability was mediated by DMN-SN connectivity ( path c ’, coefficient=1.54; 95% CI=0.04–3.23).
