 Converging evidence suggests that addiction can be considered a disease of
aberrant learning and memory with impulsive decision-making. In the past decades, numerous
studies have demonstrated that drug addiction is involved in multiple memory systems such
as classical conditioned drug memory, instrumental learning memory and the habitual
learning memory. However, most of these studies have focused on the contributions of
non-declarative memory, and declarative memory has largely been neglected in the research
of addiction. 
 Based on a recent finding that hippocampus, as a core functioning region of
declarative memory, was proved biased the decision-making process based on past
experiences by spreading associated reward values throughout memory. Our present study
focused on the hippocampus. By utilizing seed-based network analysis on the resting-state
functional MRI datasets with the seed hippocampus we tested how the intrinsic hippocampal
memory network altered towards drug addiction, and examined how the functional
connectivity strength within the altered hippocampal network correlated with behavioral
index ‘impulsivity’. 
 Our results demonstrated that HD group showed enhanced coherence between
hippocampus which represents declarative memory system and non-declarative rewardguided
learning memory system, and also showed attenuated intrinsic functional link between
hippocampus and top-down control system, compared to the CN group. This alteration was
furthered found to have behavioral significance over the behavioral index
‘impulsivity’ measured with Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS). These
results provide insights into the mechanism of declarative memory underlying the impulsive
behavior in drug addiction.

 1. Introduction 
 One of the defining clinical characteristics of drug dependence is uncontrolled
drug use in the face of adverse consequences, making the “loss of impulsive
control” the hallmark of drug addiction [ 1 – 5 ]. Individuals with addiction are
unable to base their decision-making on the long-term outcome of their choices and exhibit
uncontrolled impulsive behavior [ 6 ,  7 ]. Converging evidence from cellular, behavioral and
pharmacological studies suggests that the abnormality in decision-making of addicted
subjects can be considered a disease of aberrant learning and memory [ 8 – 11 ]. In the past decades,
studies from animal models to human subjects have demonstrated that drug addiction is
involved in multiple memory systems. For example, the mechanisms involved in classical
Pavlovian conditioned drug memory and instrumental conditioned incentive learning memory,
mediated in part by nucleus accumbens (NAcc), amygdala, and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)
could be responsible for the drug reinforcement and motivational drive, resulting in
executive control failure [ 5 ,  6 ,  12 – 15 ]. The procedural (habitual) learning disorder, mediated in part by the
caudate and the putamen, represents a transition at the neural level from prefrontal
cortical to striatal control over drug seeking and drug-taking behavior [ 16 ]. Recent resting-state functional studies supported
these findings and illustrated abnormalities in these abovementioned brain regions involved
in multiple memory systems in addiction [ 17 – 20 ]. 
 Despite having established a significant role for learning and memory in addiction,
most of these studies have focused on the contributions of non-declarative memory.
Nevertheless, memory is not a unitary process but rather consists of multiple processes that
engage distinct neural substrates. For drug memory, a major dissociation is between
declarative drug memory and non-declarative drug memory [ 21 – 23]. Distinguished from our understanding of mechanisms of
non-declarative memory such as conditioned incentive learning memory and habitual learning
memory, mechanisms of declarative memories have largely been neglected in research of
addiction [ 22 ,  23 ]. Declarative memory consists of knowledge of facts, events and biographical
memory of the personal experiences that can be explicitly stated and relies crucially on the
integrity of hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobes (MLT) [ 22 – 27 ]. In addiction for
example, declarative drug memory includes places, people or paraphernalia associated with
past drug-using experiences [ 28 ]. 
 Understanding the contributions of the declarative memory encoded by the
hippocampus may present new direction in decision-making research and highlight how humans
flexibly use previous memorized information to guide future choices in novel context,
especially those whose decision-making is adversely affected by disease such as addiction
[ 22 ]. Recently, it was reported that as a core
functioning region of declarative memory, hippocampus was activated to dynamically modulate
value representations, spreading reward values across associated item pairs, thereby
creating biased decisions based on past experience [ 29 ]. With this new mechanism in decision-making, the present study focuses on the
hippocampus [ 22 ,  23 ]. We tested how the intrinsic hippocampal memory network altered towards drug
addiction, and examined how the functional connectivity strength within the altered
hippocampal network correlated with behavioral index ‘impulsivity’ measured
with Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS) in abstinent heroin-dependent subjects. 
 
 
 2. Material and Methods 
 
 2.1. Participants 
 Thirty abstinent heroin-dependent (HD) subjects were recruited from Beijing
Ankang Hospital (Beijing, China), and 20 healthy control nondrug users (CN) also
participated in this study. Both groups of participants were comprised of right-handed
males with normal intelligence and were well matched for age and years of education.
Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria for heroin abusers and control subjects were
described in our previously publications [ 17 ,  30 ,  31 ].
Briefly, the HD subjects met DSM-IV criteria for heroin-dependence, with more than two
years of heroin use, and were abstinent for at least four weeks. They were also tested
negative for morphine in the urinalysis and negative for human HIV in blood test. None of
the subjects had a history of neurological and psychiatric diseases, seizures, head injury
or abnormalities demonstrated by an anatomical MRI scan. The inclusion and exclusion were
assessed by two experienced psychiatric physicians in accordance with the Structured
Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) (for demographic information see  Table 1 ). The study was approved by the Research Ethics
Committee of Beijing Ankang Hospital and the Beijing Institute of Basic Medical Science
and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was
obtained from all individual subjects prior to the study. Eight HD and five CN subjects
were excluded from this study due to motion artifact (i.e., translational movement
exceeded 1mm or more than 1° rotational movement), thus leaving 22 and 15 subjects
in the HD and CN groups for further analysis, respectively. 
 
 
 2.2. Behavioral measurement 
 We used impulsivity as behavioral marker of heroin addiction. Impulsivity was
assessed by using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale ver.11 (BIS-11, Chinese revised edition)
[ 32 ], which constitutes 30 4-point Likert-type
items. Higher scores signify higher impulsivity, and vice versa. All participants
completed the questionnaire. 
 
 
 2.3. MRI acquisition 
 MR-Images were acquired by using a 3T Signa GE scanner with a standard quadrature
transmit-receive head coil. The whole-brain resting-state fMRI data was acquired with a
single-shot gradient-recalled echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence, and the scanning
parameters were as follows: TE/TR=25/2000ms, flip angle=90°, slice=20, slice
thickness=5mm (with an additional 1-mm gap space), matrix size=64 × 64, FOV=24cm
× 24cm. The total 180 time points of images were collected. During the 6- minute
resting scans, all the subjects were instructed to rest, keep their heads still, eyes
closed and not to fall asleep. We also obtained high resolution anatomical images of each
individual using three dimensional T1-weighted spoiled gradient-recalled echo (SPGR) scans
with the following scanning parameters: TE/TR=4.8/10.4ms, flip angle=15°,
slice=140, slice thickness=1mm, matrix size=256 × 256, FOV=24cm × 24cm.
Besides, we also recorded cardiac activity and respiratory activity of each subject for
further use in physiological motion correction for fMRI signals. 
 
 
 2.4. Image preprocessing 
 All imaging data preprocessing and functional synchrony analyses were conducted
using the Analysis of Functional NeuroImages software (AFNI,  http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/ ),
Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8,  http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8/ ) on Matlab platform. For
imaging preprocessing, the first five volumes of the datasets were discarded due to the T1
nonequilibrium effect. This was followed by slice timing correction and volume
registration ( 3dTshift, 3dvolreg, AFNI ), linear de-trend
( 3dDetrend, AFNI ) and physiological motion correction (respiratory and
heart rate,  3dretroicor, 3dDeconvolve, AFNI ). Possible contamination from
noise including signal from white matter, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), global signal, and
six-way motion vectors (as well as their 1 st  order derivatives) were regressed
out ( 3dDeconvolve, AFNI ). A band-pass filter was then applied to keep the
low-frequency fluctuations between 0.015Hz and 0.1 Hz ( 3dFourier, AFNI )
[ 33 ,  34 ]. 
 
 
 2.5. Structural image analysis 
 Optimized Voxel-Based Morphometric (o-VBM) analysis was conducted using SPM8
( http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8 ) [ 35 ] to identify the gray matter (GM) volume of each subject in the two
groups. The individual T1-weighted images for all subjects were first segmented into three
parts: GM, white matter (WM) and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). The segmented GM was then
normalized into MNI space. In the mean time, the anatomical images were also normalized
into MNI space using the deformation field generated by the normalization of GM. The
normalized anatomical images were then segmented for the second time into GM, WM and CSF.
The o-VBM procedure was finished and the current segmented (2 nd  time) GM
(modulated images) could be extracted using a cluster detection method to determine the GM
volume for each individual ( 3dclust, AFNI, cluster detection size set as voxel
size = 2mm×2mm×2mm ). The GM volume of each individual
underwent 2-sample  t -test to see if they have significant group
difference in GM volume. If yes, the GM volume of each individual would be further used as
controlled covariate of no interest to control the GM atrophy effects when conducting the
ANCOVA test, as described below. 
 
 
 2.6. Intrinsic hippocampus functional network analysis with predefined seed
regions 
 Based on the recently demonstrated new role of the hippocampus in value-based
decision-making through dynamic modulating value representations in reward associated
declarative memory, seed regions of interest (ROIs) from the bilateral hippocampus
(spherical ROI centered at [26, -34, -12] in MNI space or [26, -33, -8] in Talairach
space, with 4-mm radius, along with its opposite side: [-26, -34, -12] in MNI space or
[-26, -33, -8] in Talairach space) were selected [ 29 ]. These predefined generic seed ROIs were further resampled and transformed
into the original space of each individual in reference with their anatomical images
( 3dfractionize, AFNI ). Only voxels in EPI functional images that
occupied more than 70% of the masked anatomical images in the resampled ROI masks
were included in the voxel-wise analysis [ 31 ]. For
each individual, the averaged time courses within the seed ROIs were then extracted from
the preprocessed EPI functional images and correlated with the time courses of all voxels
within the whole brain by using Pearson Cross-Correlation Coefficient (CC). Next, the
connectivity maps (CC map) were spatially normalized to the Talairach space and resampled
to 2-mm isotropic voxels. After applying the Fisher r-to-z transformation [z = 0.5
× log(1+r)/(1-r)] and the smoothing procedure with a Gaussian kernel (4-mm FWHM),
the intrinsic hippocampus functional network map (z-map, hereafter referred to as
‘m-map’ or ‘m-value’ to avoid confusion between
‘Fisher z’ and the normalized statistical ‘z-value’ ) for
each individual was generated and ready for our next step group comparison. 
 
 
 2.7. Statistical analysis 
 To identify the significant patterns of group-level intrinsic hippocampus
functional network for each of the two groups (results shown in  Fig. 1 ), we conducted a voxel-wise one-sample  t  test
with the m-map of each individual ( 3dttest++, AFNI ). The results were
further corrected for multiple comparisons ( 3dClustSim, AFNI,
α=0.05 ,  p <0.05, cluster size >
2630mm 3 ). 
 To find group differences of the intrinsic hippocampus functional network
(results shown in  Fig. 2  and  Table 2 ), a voxel-wise Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was employed
based on the m-map across all subjects ( 3dRegAna, AFNI ). We combined the
left- and the right- side of the m-maps together benefitted from their spatial symmetry in
pattern with a covariate labeling the ‘side’ and regressed out the
‘side’ covariate to obtain a generalized, non-lateralized intrinsic
hippocampus connectivity group difference map. The factors such as age and years of
education were also regressed out from the main effects of group as covariates of no
interest, and the GM volume was regressed out as well to reduce the effects of grey matter
atrophy to functional connectivity difference. The voxel-wise results of group difference
were corrected for multiple comparisons ( 3dClustSim, AFNI,
α=0.05 ,  p <0.05, cluster size > 2630
mm 3 ). 
 Further, in order to detect brain regions with behavioral significance of
decision-making tendency regarding the behavioral index ‘impulsivity’
(results shown in  Fig. 3 ), we conducted a whole-brain
voxel-wise linear regression analysis ( 3dRegAna, AFNI ) between the m-maps
and the measured BIS total scores of all subjects within each of the two groups. This
analysis was performed separately for the HD and the CN group. Similar to the procedure of
group difference analysis, the factors such as ‘side’, age, years of
education and GM volume were controlled as covariates of no interest. The behavioral
significance maps of the two groups were also corrected for multiple comparisons
( 3dClustSim, AFNI, α=0.05 ,  p <0.05,
cluster size > 2630 mm 3 ). 
 Finally, through conjunction analyses between the impulsivity behavioral
correlation patterns of CN and HD group, we assessed those overlapped regions of the two
groups that exhibited behavioral (impulsivity) significance. The regions based on
conjunction analysis results are used as ROIs to identify the linear correlation
relationship between the averaged m-values within each of the ROIs and the BIS total
scores for the CN and the HD groups respectively. 
 
 
 
 3. Results 
 
 3.1. Demographic and psychometric data of the behavioral measurement 
 The demographic and Clinical Evaluation information in  Table 1  showed no significant difference in age and years of education
between the HD and the CN group. The BIS total score of the HD group was significantly
higher than that of the CN group ( p <0.05). 
 
 
 3.2. oVBM results of the HD and CN groups 
 Our oVBM analysis revealed that the gray matter volume of subjects in HD group
was significantly lower than that of the CN group ( p <0.05), as
shown in  Table 1 . The GM volume obtained for each
individual was further utilized as controlled covariate in the following ANCOVA test to
control the effect of GM atrophy. 
 
 
 3.3. Connectivity patterns of the intrinsic hippocampus functional network for the CN
and HD groups 
 As shown in  Fig. 1A  (left panel), for the
left hippocampus network, in the CN group, the positively correlated regions included the
bilateral hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala, middle temporal gyrus (MTG, BA21),
anterior temporal pole (aTP, BA38), subcallosal gyrus (BA25), orbital frontal cortex (OFC,
BA11), thalamus, posterior cingulate/precuneus (PCC, BA23/31), cuneus (BA23) and lentiform
nucleus/putamen, right insula. The anticorrelated regions included the bilateral fusiform
gyrus (BA37), lingual gyrus, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC, BA24/32), dorsal
medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC, BA8/6), dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, BA9/46),
postcentral gyrus (BA2/3/4), inferior parietal lobule (IPL, BA40) and left precentral
gyrus (BA6). In the HD group as shown in  Fig. 1A 
(right panel), the positively correlated regions were mainly located in the regions of the
temporal-parietal cortices and subcortical regions, including the bilateral hippocampus,
precuneus (BA7), PCC (BA23/31), cuneus (17/18/19), orbital frontal cortex (OFC, BA11),
amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, subcallosal gyrus (BA25), thalamus, lentiform
nucleus/putamen, caudate, nucleus accumbens (NAcc), insula (BA13), superior temporal gyrus
(STG, BA41) and right AG/TPJ (angular gyrus/temporal-parietal junction, BA/39). The
anticorrelated regions were mainly located in the frontal system including the bilateral
DLPFC (BA9/46), DMPFC (BA9/6), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, BA44/45), dACC (BA24/32) and
the right fusiform gyrus (BA37). Similar patterns of the right hippocampus network for
both the CN and the HD groups are illustrated in  Fig.
1B . 
 
 
 3.4. Group-level difference of the intrinsic hippocampus functional network between
the HD and the CN groups 
 Several brain regions within the intrinsic hippocampus functional network showed
significant differences between the HD group and the CN group via ANCOVA procedure. Among
these regions, increased functional connectivity could be seen mainly in the limbic areas
and some of the cortical regions, including bilateral insula (BA13), putamen, caudate,
subcallosal gyrus/subgenual ACC (SCG/sACC, BA25), PCC (BA23/31), paracentral lobule
(BA31/5), precuneus (BA7), cuneus (BA18), and TPJ, while the decreased functional
connectivity were largely distributed in the cortices and some subcortical areas,
including the bilateral DLPFC (BA9/46), DMPFC (BA6/9), right anterior temporal pole (aTP,
BA38), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC, BA32) left MTG (BA22), amygdala, aTP and
fusiform face area (FFA, BA37). These results are illustrated in  Fig. 2  and  Table 2 . 
 
 
 3.5. Neural correlation between the intrinsic hippocampus functional network strength
(m-value) and the behavioral index ‘impulsivity’ in the HD and the CN
groups 
 The voxel-wise multivariate regression analysis identified distinct behavioral
correlation patterns of the hippocampus network for the two groups. In the CN group ( Fig. 3A ), the positive correlation pattern mainly
consisted of the regions including the bilateral IFG (BA47), ACC (BA32), MTG (BA21),
parahippocampal gyrus, ITG, cuneus/lingual gyrus (BA18), ventral lateral thalamus and aTP
(BA38), left DMPFC (BA6/8), right AG/TPJ (BA39). The negatively correlated regions of the
CN group include the bilateral FFA (BA37), dorsal thalamus, dorsal caudate body,
postcentral gyrus (BA3), precentral gyrus (BA4), paracentral lobule (BA6), precuneus
(BA7), IPL (BA40), and the right lentiform/putamen. In the HD group ( Fig. 3B ), positively correlated areas included the bilateral dorsal
medial thalamus, MCC (BA24), right dorsal caudate body, left FFA (BA37) and MFG (BA6/8),
while the negatively correlated regions of the HD group included the bilateral IPL (BA40),
ACC (BA24/32), left DLPFC (BA9), and the right insula/IFG (BA47). 
 The conjunction analysis identified the overlapped regions between  Fig. 3A and Fig. 3B , as shown in  Fig. 4A . These regions included the bilateral dorsal thalamus, left ITG
(BA20/37), ACC (BA24/32), postcentral gyrus, precentral gyrus, right dorsal caudate body,
MFG (BA6), IPL and IFG. From the multivariate regression analysis, as shown by  Fig. 4B and Fig. 4C , the CN and the HD group exhibited
contrary correlation pattern in the following regions: the right caudate body and the left
ACC. For the right caudate body ( Fig. 4B ), in the CN
group, the m-value was negatively correlated with the BIS total score, indicating the
stronger connectivity with hippocampus of right caudate body, the less evident the
impulsivity. However, in the HD group, such a relationship was the opposite. The stronger
the m-value, the severer the impulsivity, the impulsivity in HD group is positively
correlated with the connectivity strength of the right caudate body to hippocampus. For
the left ACC ( Fig. 4C ), in the CN group, the m-value
was positively correlated with the BIS total score, indicating the stronger the
impulsivity, the stronger the connectivity strength with the hippocampus. In the HD group,
however, it was the opposite, suggesting impaired controllability. 
 
 
 
 4. Discussion 
 Understanding how hippocampus is intrinsically connected to the other part of the
brain provides insight into the mechanisms of declarative memory in drug-taking and
drug-seeking behaviors in addiction. 
 Our current study demonstrated a new set of results that in both of the two
groups, hippocampus was functionally connected to NAcc, OFC, caudate and putamen. The HD
subjects showed stronger functional connectivity between hippocampus and multiple cortical
and subcortical regions including putamen, caudate, PCC, precuneus, insula and
temporal-parietal junction and relatively weaker connectivity in regions of amygdala and
cortical areas including anterior temporal pole, DLPFC, ACC and DMPFC, compared to the CN
subjects ( Fig. 2  and  Table 2 ). Further from the results of the multivariate regression analysis, we
identified distinct behavior correlation of impulsivity in each of the two groups ( Fig. 3 ). We also identified overlapped regions between the
impulsivity correlation patterns of the two groups by using conjunction analysis ( Fig. 4A ). Our main finding of behavioral correlation
analysis is that the CN group and HD group revealed contrary impulsivity correlation in the
regions of the left ACC and right dorsal caudate body within the hippocampus memory network
( Fig. 4B and Fig. 4C ). For the right dorsal caudate
body, the connectivity strength was positively correlated with impulsivity in HD subjects,
whereas in CN subjects, such a correlation was negative. For the left ACC, the connectivity
strength was negatively correlated with impulsivity in HD subjects, whereas in CN subjects,
such a relationship was positive correlation. 
 These results corroborate earlier findings and extend them in three ways [ 11 ,  36 ]. First,
our findings demonstrate that declarative memory system and non-declarative memory
(reward-related learning) system are intrinsically connected. In both the HD and the CN
groups, as central node of declarative memory, hippocampus was intrinsically connected to
NAcc, OFC, caudate and putamen. NAcc and OFC have been demonstrated to be involved in
reward-related learning such as classical and instrumental conditioned-incentive learning
and memory, habit/procedure learning and instrumental learning [ 6 ,  12 – 16 ,  37 – 39 ]. The intrinsic connectivity between hippocampus and
these regions involved in the reward-related learning suggests that multiple memory systems
are functionally associated. 
 Second, our findings have implications that the declarative drug memory system and
non-declarative drug memory (reward-related learning) system have enhanced association in
heroin addiction. In our study, the caudate and putamen showed stronger connectivity with
hippocampus in the HD group. These regions are not only involved in non-declarative learning
memory [ 22 ,  23 ], but also are major parts of the ventral neural network or the
'β-network' in neuroeconomics’ term which mediates immediate
rewards [ 40 ,  41 ]. According to the neuroeconomics' theory, reward-related valuation is
the central part in the process of making decisions when facing alternative options [ 42 – 44 ].
The stronger coupling between these two memory systems could bias immediate and impulsive
behaviors in HD subjects [ 45 ]. The present study
further supports this notion by demonstrating stronger intrinsic functional coupling between
the hippocampus and the dorsal striatum, indicating stronger declarative - non-declarative
memory coherence in the HD subjects. Furthermore, this stronger connectivity between the
hippocampus and caudate in HD subjects has behavioral significance. The stronger the
connectivity, the severer the impulsivity. The nature of this positive correlation provides
a biological basis as to why drug-associated declarative memory could trigger impulsive drug
use. 
 Third, our findings not only indicate that the declarative drug memory system is
more closely associated with non-declarative drug memory (reward related learning) system in
the HD group, as described above, but also has attenuated intrinsic link with the top-down
executive control system. In our study, the dACC, DLPFC and DMPFC showed relative weaker
connectivity with hippocampus in the HD group. The DLPFC plays an important role in high
order executive control such as self-impulse control by integrating sensory and mnemonic
information [ 46 ,  47 ]. Various studies have identified that the dACC and DMPFC are crucially
functioning in error detection and conflict monitoring for impulsive inhibitory control
[ 48 ,  49 ].
Attenuated activity in ACC and decreased connectivity between hippocampus and DMPFC were
also detected in subjects with cocaine addiction, nicotine addiction, heroin/opiate
addiction, and even subjects with acute heroin administration [ 30 ,  50 – 54 ]. These regions with decreased hippocampus
connectivity are also the major regions of the 'δ network' in
neuroeconomics theory and are considered to carry out the executive control function by
taking the long-term value into account when facing alternatives in decision-making [ 40 ,  41 ,  45 ,  55 ].
Furthermore, the connectivity between the hippocampus and ACC also has behavioral
significance. For the CN group, the stronger the connectivity, the higher the impulsivity,
indicating strengthened functional coupling between hippocampus and ACC for stronger
controllability in individuals with higher impulsive level in CN group. However in HD group,
this behavioral correlation was reversed. The weaker the connectivity, the severer the
impulsivity, indicating their relativity weaker controllability for impulsive behaviors. 
 In summary, the strengthened connectivity between the hippocampus and the
non-declarative drug memory (reward-related learning) regions could be neural mechanisms
underlying the pathologically enhancement of motivational drive toward impulsive
drug-related behaviors at a system level in the HD group. While the attenuated connectivity
between the hippocampus and the executive control related regions therefore could be neural
mechanisms underlying the impaired impulsive control ability over drug-related behaviors at
a system level in the HD group. In heroin addiction, these two parts reciprocally form an
imbalance between the impetus and the resistance towards drug-related behavior. Based on
these discussions, we could further infer that the decision-making processes and the
impulsive behaviors are dependent not only on the executive control system for top-down
control [ 3 ], but also on the non-declarative
reward-related learning memory system for bottom-up drive. It is dependent on the balance of
the two systems, instead of on one system alone. Such an inference may advance the debate
among the single model, dual valuation model and self-control model during the conflict
decision-making processes [ 40 ,  41 ,  46 ,  56 ]. 
 Digging into the intrinsic connectivity of hippocampus could provide scientific
evidence for brain mechanisms of declarative memory, thus shedding light on the process of
developing new strategy of treating addiction. New candidate treatment strategy should focus
not only on non-declarative drug memory extinction and disruption of declarative drug memory
reconsolidation process, but also on shearing the interaction between these two memory
systems and reestablish the association between the memory system and the executive control
system. 
 Several limitations of our study should be considered. First, we revealed
functional reorganization in the hippocampus declarative memory network in abstinent heroin
addiction subjects. However it is not clear whether it is the alteration in functional
connectivity lead to addiction or it is the long-term exposure to addictive drugs lead to
the alteration in functional connectivity. Future studies could be conducted to probe into
this question by exploring the genetic factor in addiction, such as sibling study. Second,
this is a cross-sectional study without treatment. Future studies entailing longitudinal
studies with detoxification treatment are needed to evaluate the alterations in brain
function under treatment and might provide new insight into the treatment strategy of drug
addiction.

 Fig. 1 
 
 Connectivity patterns of the intrinsic hippocampus functional network for two
groups both seeded in the left (Fig. 1A) and right (Fig. 1B) hippocampus. The bright color
marked brain regions with positive functional connectivity and the blue color show
anticorrelated connectivity. The left part of the Fig. 1A and Fig. 1B indicates
connectivity patterns for the CN group, and the right part for the HD group. The letters
‘R’ and ‘L’ on top of the axial images show the side of
the hemisphere; the numbers below the axial images indicate the slice position at the
 z -coordinate. This group-level pattern is obtained via a voxel-wise
1-sample  t -test and significance level was set at threshold
 p  < 0.05. The results were corrected for multiple comparisons
( 3dClustSim, AFNI, α=0.05, p <0.05, cluster size
> 2630mm 3 ). 
 Abbreviations: CN, control non-drug users; HD, heroin dependent subjects. 
 
 
 
 
 Fig. 2 
 
 Illustration of the group-level difference of the intrinsic hippocampus
functional network between the HD and the CN groups. The bright color illustrates brain
regions with higher connectivity strength in the HD group while the blue color indicates
lower connectivity strength, compared to the CN group. Significance level of this
group-level difference was set at threshold  p  < 0.05, and
 p  value of each voxel was obtained via a voxel-wise analysis of
covariance (ANCOVA) with age, years of education and grey matter volume of each individual
as covariance of non-interests. The results were corrected for multiple comparisons
( 3dClustSim, AFNI, α=0.05 ,  p <0.05,
cluster size > 2630mm 3 ). 
 Abbreviations: DLPFC, dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex; Amy, amygdala; aTP,
anterior temporal pole; PCC, posterior cingulate cortex; FFA, fusiform face area; DMPFC,
dorsal medial prefrontal cortex; AG, angular gyrus; TPJ, temporal-parietal junction; dACC,
dorsal anterior cingulate cortex; CN, control non-drug users; HD, heroin dependent
subjects. 
 
 
 
 
 Fig. 3 
 
 The voxel-wise correlation between the intrinsic hippocampus functional network
strength (m-value) and the BIS Total score in the HD group (A) and the CN group (B).
Bright color in these patterns indicates positive correlation between BIS total score and
the connectivity strength, while blue color indicates negative correlation. The age, years
of education and gray matter volume of each individual were controlled as covariates of no
interests. The significance level of these two distinct behavioral correlation patterns
were set at threshold  p  < 0.05, and the results were corrected
for multiple comparisons ( 3dClustSim, AFNI, α=0.05 ,
 p <0.05, cluster size > 2630mm 3 ). 
 Abbreviations: CN, control non-drug users; HD, heroin dependent subjects.

 (A) Results from the conjunction analysis between  Fig. 3A and Fig. 3B . (B) The significant correlations between the connectivity
strength of hippocampus - right dorsal caudate body and the BIS total score in CN subjects
(the left panel) and in the HD subjects (the right panel). (C) The significant
correlations between the connectivity strength of hippocampus - left ACC and the BIS total
score in CN subjects (left panel) and in the HD subjects (right panel). 
 Abbreviations: rdCaudBody, right dorsal caudate body; lACC, left anterior

 Highlights 
 
 We revealed brain mechanism of how declarative memory affected addicted brain. 
 We based memory network on new role of hippocampus in value-based
decision-making. 
 We utilized R-fMRI combined with temporal binding model using the seed
hippocampus. 
 Non-declarative learning and executive control regions are imbalanced link with
seed. 
 Dorsal caudate body and ACC have reversed impulsivity correlation between two
groups.
