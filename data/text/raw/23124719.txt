 The majority of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) experience disturbances of episodic memory from structural damage or dysfunction of the hippocampus. The objective of this study was to use functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to identify regions where resting state connectivity to the left hippocampus (LH) is correlated with neuropsychological measures of verbal memory retention in TLE patients. 
 Eleven left TLE (LTLE) patients and 15 control subjects participated in resting state fMRI scans. All LTLE patients underwent neuropsychological testing. Resting state functional connectivity maps to the LH were calculated for each patient, and subsequently used in a multiple regression analysis with verbal memory retention scores as a covariate. The analysis identified brain regions whose connectivity to the LH was linearly related to memory retention scores across the group of patients. 
 In LTLE patients, right sided (contralateral) clusters in the precuneus and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) exhibited increased connectivity to the LH with increased memory retention score; left sided (ipsilateral) regions in the precuneus and IPL showed increased connectivity to the LH with decreased retention score. Patients with high memory retention scores had greater connectivity between the LH – right parietal clusters than between the LH – left parietal clusters; in contrast, control subjects had significantly and consistently greater LH – left hemisphere than LH – right hemisphere connectivity 
 Our results suggest that increased connectivity in contralateral hippocampal functional pathways within the episodic verbal memory network represents a strengthening of alternative pathways in LTLE patients with strong verbal memory retention abilities.

 Introduction 
 Deficits in episodic memory, i.e. the capacity to store, recall, and encode information about personal events and experiences at specific times and places, is considered the primary neurocognitive dysfunction among temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients ( Helmstaedter 2002 ). This memory impairment has been documented in nearly all TLE cases ( Fisher, et al. 2000 ;  Hermann and Seidenberg 2008 ). Neuropsychological testing of TLE patients with confirmed structural hippocampal abnormalities provides evidence that the dysfunction is related to these structural changes ( Kilpatrick, et al. 1997 ;  Miller, et al. 1993 ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have also determined relationships between measures of hippocampal structure (such as the volume of the hippocampus or T 2  relaxation times) as well as other parameters of TLE, such as: age of onset of epilepsy, age, duration of epilepsy, with various neuropsychological test scores ( Baxendale, et al. 1998 ). While structural damage to the hippocampus itself may play a role in the memory dysfunctions, it is likely subsumed by a complex network of regions that include connections from the mesial temporal lobe to the neocortex ( Eichenbaum 2000 ). A decline in episodic memory function in TLE that has been seen in the absence of structural hippocampal damage ( Helmstaedter 2002 ) also supports this idea. Therefore, it is important to examine the neural circuitry responsible for episodic memory function in order to better understand how and if the connections change with disease. 
 MRI functional connectivity mapping is one of the most effective non-invasive methods for mapping widespread functional networks ( Rogers, et al. 2007 ). Functional connectivity mapping determines regions of the brain whose resting blood oxygenation fluctuations are synchronous. This synchronicity implies connectivity between regions and has been investigated across many healthy ( Damoiseaux, et al. 2006 ;  Newton, et al. 2007 ) and diseased ( Greicius, et al. 2004 ;  Zhou, et al. 2008 ) populations. In TLE, increases in functional connectivity have been associated with language and memory impairments ( Vlooswijk, et al. 2010 ;  Waites, et al. 2006 ). However, these studies focused on regions previously identified as language or memory areas in healthy subjects. It is unclear whether regions outside of these normal networks are recruited to aid in the performance of memory functions in TLE patients. 
 The goal of this study is to examine the relationship between the resting state functional connectivity of the hippocampus and neuropsychological measures of memory, in particular, the amount of verbal memory (California Verbal Learning Test, 2 nd  Edition; CVLT-II) representation retained (that is, the information successfully consolidated and stored) after learning in well-characterized surgical epilepsy candidates at our center. A whole brain connectivity analysis to the hippocampus was employed. We hypothesized that modifications in functional connectivity across networks involving the hippocampus may be associated with memory retention ability. Specific alterations in functional connectivity among LTLE patients will expand our understanding of the effect of TLE across the brain on specific functional networks. Further, we speculate that the identification of modified functional networks may provide new targets for investigations of biomarkers of episodic memory function. 
 
 
 Methods 
 
 Subjects 
 The main inclusion criterion for the study was unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy by ictal and interictal EEG, not due to structural lesions other than hippocampal sclerosis. We recruited 60 patients with possible TLE from the Vanderbilt University Epilepsy Program. Video-EEG monitoring with scalp EEG in the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit classified 24 patients with pure left TLE (LTLE) (only left temporal interictal discharges and ictal EEG onsets). Of the 24 patients with LTLE, 13 had undergone neuropsychological testing. Of these 13 patients, one was eliminated due to a cavernous angioma and one was excluded as a result of severe distortions in the fMRI scans. For the final analysis, 11 patients with LTLE (mean age ± standard deviation (SD) = 36 ± 11 yrs, 8 female, 1 left-handed) were suitable for analysis. Six of the eleven patients in the study were identified as having mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) from a clinical MRI scan. Of the remaining five patients, three underwent surgery and were seizure free post surgery; two of the three were classified as having MTS post surgery based on pathology findings. See  Table I  for individual patient characteristics. Fifteen normal healthy volunteers (mean age ± SD = 31 ± 11 yrs, 12 female) participated in this study. All controls were right handed by self-report. None of the subjects had a history of neurological, psychiatric or medical conditions as determined by interview. The control subjects were taken from a different study, and as a result did not undergo neuropsychological testing. All subjects gave written informed consent. 
 
 
 Neuropsychological Testing 
 For this study we used neuropsychological scores from standard preoperative memory tests routinely administered by the Vanderbilt University Epilepsy Program. We used the CVLT-II percentage-retention score as a measure of verbal memory. This corresponds to the List A Long Delay free recall raw score divided by the greatest of the five raw score values in the List A Total, and is a measure of verbal memory storage from learning. The CVLT-II ( Delis 2000b ) is a supraspan verbal list learning test that is associated with the ability of the dominant hemisphere mesial temporal lobe to store memories in epilepsy surgical candidates ( Hermann, et al. 1994 ;  Seidenberg, et al. 1996 ). 
 
 
 Imaging 
 All study participants underwent an MRI scan on a 3T MRI scanner (Philips Healthcare, Inc., Best, Netherlands). Subjects were instructed to rest with their eyes closed and lie still. Foam padding was utilized to prevent head motion. Conventional MRI included three-dimensional anatomic T 1 -weighted images and two-dimensional T 1 -weighted images. Functional images of the whole brain were acquired axially using a gradient-echo echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence (TR = 2000 ms, TE = 35 ms, scan resolution = 64 × 64, FOV = 240 mm, voxel size = 3.75 mm × 3.75 × 5.00 mm, 30 slices and 300 dynamics (200 dynamics for healthy controls taken from a different study)). 
 
 
 Calculation of Hippocampal Volumes 
 We calculated and included a hippocampal volume ratio in our study to account for possible variations in hippocampal volume across the patient group. We calculated the volume of the right and left hippocampus for all patients and controls using SPM8 ( http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm ). We began with the hippocampus mask as defined by the WFUpickatlas toolbox ( http://fmri.wfubmc.edu/software/PickAtlas ) and matched it to the dimensions of the 3D anatomic T 1 -weighted image. Next we created a transformation matrix between the WFUpickatlas hippocampal mask and each patient’s 3D T 1 -weighted image. The WFUpickatlas left hippocampus mask was then spatially normalized using each individual transformation matrix. Lastly, for each patient’s transformed WFUpickatlas hippocampus mask the voxels were summed and converted to cm 3 . We standardized the scores by dividing the volume of the left hippocampus by the right hippocampus (L/R). We expected the hippocampal volume ratio to be close to 1 for controls, whereas in comparison we expected a reduced ratio in patients. 
 
 
 Functional Image Preprocessing and Regions of Interest Identification 
 The images were preprocessed and analyzed using the statistical parametric mapping software package SPM8. The functional image sets were corrected for slice timing effects, motion corrected, and spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template utilizing co-registration to the three-dimensional and two-dimensional T 1 -weighted structural images. This resulted in a functional image series of 46 × 55 × 46 voxels (4 mm × 4 mm × 4 mm). These images were spatially smoothed using an 8 mm FWHM kernel. For functional connectivity analysis the preprocessed data was low-pass filtered at 0.1 Hz ( Cordes, et al. 2001 ). 
 For the LTLE patients our region of interest (ROI) for the connectivity analysis was chosen to be the left hippocampus (LH). We used the atlas in the WFUpickatlas toolbox to define the ROI. For each LTLE patient, we calculated the averaged fMRI time course across all voxels in the LH as the seed time course for the connectivity analysis. Using the low-pass filtered fMRI images for each patient we performed a general linear model analysis with the seed time course as the regressor of interest, with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) time course and the six motion time courses input as covariates. The averaged CSF time course was calculated across all voxels based on the CSF mask provided in SPM8. This resulted in resting state functional connectivity maps to the LH for each LTLE patient.  Figure 1  shows a resting state functional connectivity map for a control and patient respectively. 
 Next, a multiple regression second-level analysis was performed using the individual connectivity maps created in the first-level functional connectivity analysis of the LTLE patients and the LH, with the CVLT-II percentage-retention score used as a covariate and the (L/R) hippocampal volume ratio included as a nuisance covariate. The results display regions whose connectivity to the LH at rest is correlated with the CVLT-II retention score across the group of LTLE patients. This means that the resting state functional connectivity between these regions and the LH is decreased in patients who performed poorly on the CVLT-II (positive correlation). In addition, we identified regions whose resting state functional connectivity to the LH increased with decreased CVLT-II retention scores (negative correlation). The results were thresholded at p < 0.005 (uncorrected) with a cluster size greater than 10 contiguous voxels. 
 For regions identified in the second-level analysis in patients, the connectivity to the LH was also calculated in each control subject. An unpaired  t -test was used to determine whether there was a statistically significant difference in resting state connectivity between the patients and controls in these networks. The statistical threshold was p < 0.1 (false discovery rate (FDR) corrected) with an extent threshold cluster size of 10 continuous voxels. 
 
 
 
 Results 
 Overall, for all ages and genders the mean normal percentage retention score is 0.868 ( Delis 2000a ) out of 1. The mean CVLT-II percentage retention score for this patient group was 0.727 with a range of scores from 0 to 1. Four of the 11 LTLE patients scored above the normal mean score. To better understand how the patient’s memory performance compares to healthy controls, we examined the normalized z-scores of the delayed recall standardized scores. The CVLT-II retention score is based on the raw delayed recall score divided by the greatest of the five raw score values in the List A Total (to correct for any susceptibility to proactive interference during learning); as such, the CVLT-II retention score is significantly correlated with the normalized delayed recall z-scores (r = 0.83, p = 0.001). The average normalized z-score of the delayed memory performance for the patients was within 1.5 standard deviations below the mean (mean = 1.29) of individuals without neurological illness. Among the patients who performed more poorly relative to the normal population (<1.5 SD), three patients had delayed memory performances below the 1 st  percentile, three fell below the 2 nd  percentile, and one patient's performance fell at the 5 th  percentile. 
 An unpaired  t -test of the (L/R) hippocampal volume ratio of the LTLE patients and the controls found a significant reduction in the volume ratio (p = 0.02) in the patient group. The greatest reductions in this ratio were seen in patients with MTS. As some of the LTLE patients were not classified as having MTS, it was not surprising that the hippocampal volume ratio of some patients was similar to that found for control subjects (ratio ~ 1). We considered the statistically significant reduction of the hippocampal volume ratio in the patient group to be a validation of our method. 
 The second-level analysis of the LTLE patient group found several right sided (contralateral) regions that exhibited higher resting state connectivity to the LH when the CVLT-II retention was higher among all patients, specifically regions in the mid-right precuneus, the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and the right insula/precentral gyrus which are all shown in  Figure 2A . We found significant left sided (ipsilateral) regions which demonstrated lower resting state connectivity to the LH when the CVLT-II retention score was higher, the most significant regions were in the left precuneus/cingulate gyrus (Brodmann Area (BA) 31), the left IPL and the left middle frontal gyrus (BA6) shown in  Figure 2B . 
 Plots of the linear relationship between the resting state connectivity to the LH and the CVLT-II retention scores for the regions in  Figure 2  are shown in  Figures 3  and  4 . Patients have been color coded in terms of whether or not they have MTS as identified in  Table I , and it can be seen that neither group drives the correlation. We also computed the resting state connectivity between these regions and the LH in the control subjects. The connectivity in the LTLE patients was not significantly different from the control subjects in any of the regions. 
 Table II  presents a statistical summary of all regions found in the second-level analysis. We calculated the adjusted R 2  to account for the (L/R) hippocampal volume ratio used as a nuisance regressor in our second-level analysis. Since one patient (No. 6 in  Table I ) had a retention score of zero and could arguably be considered an outlier, we also calculated the statistics for each region without this subject. With the exception of the clusters in the left middle frontal gyrus and the left IPL, all R 2  values decrease with the exclusion of the potential outlier. The results in the mid-right precuneus and right IPL exhibit more dependence on the potential outlier than the other clusters, however all R 2  values demonstrate a significant relationship between resting state connectivity and the measure of retention. 
 Figure 5  shows the linear relationships (shown in  Figures 3  and  4 ) in terms of the resting state functional connectivity in the ipsilateral IPL vs. the contralateral IPL as well as the ipsilateral precuneus vs. the contralateral precuneus across patients. The linear relationships displayed in  Figure 5  are significant in the patient group (ipsilateral vs. contralateral precuneus: r = −0.79 and p = 0.0035; ipsilateral vs. contralateral IPL: r = −0.79 and p = 0.0038), but not in the control group (ipsilateral vs. contralateral precuneus: r = 0.41 and p = 0.13; left vs. right IPL: r = −0.073 and p = 0.80). 
 Interestingly, we found all control subjects had significantly higher connectivity from the LH to the ipsilateral precuneus and IPL clusters than to the contralateral precuneus and IPL clusters. But in the LTLE patient group, two and four patients demonstrated  higher  connectivity between the LH and clusters in the  contralateral  IPL and precuneus, respectively. Specifically, in  Figure 5A  we observe that two of the top five scoring patients have greater connectivity between the LH and the contralateral IPL cluster as compared to the ipsilateral IPL cluster. Similarly, in  Figure 5B  we observe that the four patients with high retention scores displayed greater resting state connectivity between the LH and the contralateral precuneus cluster versus the ipsilateral precuneus cluster. 
 
 
 Discussion 
 This is the first study to investigate resting networks across the whole brain in order to identify modifications in functional connectivity associated with verbal memory retention abilities in TLE. Our results suggest that LTLE patients with higher episodic memory retention scores undergo contralateral connectivity alterations in specific regions in the brain. In addition, since our analysis focused on the relationship between memory retention ability and connectivity to the LH within the patient group, we were able to find changes in connectivity that were not revealed in a whole brain comparison of connectivity between the patients and healthy controls. 
 The results of our analysis show that among the 11 LTLE patients, those with higher CVLT-II verbal memory retention scores have higher resting state functional connectivity between the LH and the contralateral precuneus and IPL, and lower connectivity between the LH and the ipsilateral precuneus and IPL. The control group had significantly and consistently higher connectivity between the LH and the ipsilateral precuneus and IPL than between the LH and the contralateral precuneus and IPL. 
 We did not find a statistically significant increase in functional connectivity to the LH between the patient group and the healthy control group in any one region, which is typically interpreted as a compensatory effect. However, the changes in connectivity observed imply the strengthening of contralateral functional pathways within the verbal memory retention system that are associated with improved memory retention abilities within the patient group. Specifically, we observe that the stronger the LH – contralateral precuneus/IPL verbal memory functional pathways, the better patients perform on verbal memory retrieval tasks. 
 Functional interhemispheric asymmetries (contralateral > ipsilateral) have been observed in TLE patients in relation to memory networks. Richardson and colleagues ( Richardson, et al. 2003 ) found verbal memory encoding involved the left hippocampus in healthy controls, whereas in LTLE patients activation was observed in the contralateral hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus. A study by Addis and colleagues ( Addis, et al. 2007 ) examined the autobiographical memory (AM) neural network in LTLE patients; they found reduction in the strength of connections involving the left hippocampus and an increased strength among extra-hippocampal AM nodes. Two resting state functional connectivity studies ( Bettus, et al. 2010 ;  Bettus, et al. 2009 ) found a contralateral increase in connectivity in the temporal lobe in TLE patients. The 2009 study ( Bettus, et al. 2009 ) found increased memory performance associated with increased contralateral basal functional connectivity suggesting alternative functional pathways were recruited within the memory network. A 2011 study by Guedj and colleagues ( Guedj, et al. 2011 ) looked at the perceptive-memory network in TLE patients, specifically they compared activations between unilateral TLE patients who performed poorly on recognition memory tasks to patients whose performance was considered normal, as well as to healthy controls. In comparison with patients with normal recognition scores, patients with weak scores demonstrated stronger activation in a number of regions, including bilaterally within the cingulate cortex, precuneus and the inferior parietal cortex. They conclude that for patients with poor recognition performance, the impairment in the perceptive memory system leads to different activation within an inefficient attentional network. Similarly, we found modified functional pathways used by patients with better memory retention performance. 
 In addition to observed functional changes, a number of PET studies have found significant increases in metabolism in regions contralateral to the seizure focus ( Rubin, et al. 1995 ;  Trotta, et al. 2011 ;  Van Bogaert, et al. 2000 ). Trotta and colleagues ( Trotta, et al. 2011 ) also found high intracarotid amobarbital test (IAT) scores correlated with high contralateral metabolic values that they interpret as metabolic evidence for episodic memory plasticity in the contralateral temporal lobe in LTLE patients. 
 Numerous studies support the hypothesis that regions in the parietal lobe - the precuneus and IPL - as well as regions in the frontal lobe - the middle frontal gyrus and the insula/precentral gyrus - play a role in episodic memory ( Cavanna and Trimble 2006 ;  Fernandez G 1998 ;  Fletcher, et al. 1998 ;  Grasby, et al. 1993 ;  Henson, et al. 1999 ;  Shallice, et al. 1994 ;  Suzuki, et al. 2009 ;  Tulving, et al. 1994 ;  Wagner, et al. 2005 ). The precuneus and the inferior parietal lobe are known to be part of the default mode network, which has been implicated in episodic memory processing as a result of co-activation to the hippocampus ( Greicius, et al. 2004 ). The role of the precuneus region has been described as related to multimodal memory integration during retrieval, and has been seen in word association recall paradigms ( Krause, et al. 1999 ). Thus, we may have observed interhemispheric functional strengthening in this mesial temporal – parietal circuit in TLE due to the necessity of this functional network in declarative memory retrieval, albeit to the opposite hemisphere presumed to circumvent less efficient intrahemispheric functional abilities. 
 
 Methodological considerations 
 It is possible that resting state connectivity and the neuropsychological scores used for analysis (CVLT-II retention scores) are correlated with a third variable, and thus not directly related. We included age, age of onset and duration of disease each separately as a covariate in the second-level analysis, and none of the variables significantly influenced our original findings. None of these variables was significantly correlated with CVLT-II verbal retention scores. A study by Baxendale and colleagues found age of onset to be correlated with CVLT-II percentage-retention scores, which we do not find in our data ( Baxendale, et al. 1998 ). 
 In order to account for potential differences in hippocampal volume within the patient group, we included a hippocampal volume ratio in our analysis. As eight of the eleven LTLE patients were labeled with MTS, we used the inclusion of a hippocampal volume ratio to incorporate this factor into our model. We did not determine the volume by visually tracing each subject’s structural image, but rather used an automated method. Another possible method to account for hippocampal volume differences is the inclusion of a segmentation step to restrict the hippocampal ROI to include only gray matter in patients with hippocampal sclerosis. However, we smoothed our data with an 8 mm filter, which results in the blurring of gray and white matter. Ultimately, we chose to include a hippocampal volume ratio as a nuisance variable in our second-level analysis to account for possible differences in hippocampal volume across patients. 
 We also included both the CSF time course and the six motion parameters as nuisance variables to account for physiological noise ( Lund and Hanson 2001 ). Finally, language and memory dominance were not considered in this study, but may be considered in future studies. 
 
 
 
 Conclusion 
 In summary, we investigated differences in resting state functional connectivity to the left hippocampus associated with verbal memory retention ability in LTLE patients. We found greater left hippocampal connectivity to the contralateral parietal lobe in LTLE patients with normal verbal memory retention scores compared to healthy control subjects. Our results suggest that increased connectivity in contralateral hippocampal functional pathways within the episodic verbal memory network represents a strengthening of alternative pathways in LTLE patients with strong verbal memory retention abilities.

 Regions showing significant correlation between resting state connectivity to the LH and CVLT-II percentage retention score across group of 11 LTLE patients A) Cluster in the mid-right precuneus (magenta), right inferior parietal lobule (green) and right insula (yellow) showing positive correlation (decreased connectivity with decreased score). B) Cluster in the left precuneus (yellow), left inferior parietal lobule (red) and left middle frontal gyrus (cyan) demonstrating a negative correlation (increased connectivity with decreased score). 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 3 
 
 Positive linear correlation between connectivity to the LH and the CVLT-II percentage retention scores in three brain regions. A) The right inferior parietal lobule. B) The mid-right precuneus. C) The right insula/precentral gyrus. Patients with MTS are shown in red, and patients without MTS are shown in blue as identified in  Table I . CVLT-II scores are unitless and beta values have arbitrary units. Linear regression was used to fit a line to the LTLE patient data for each plot. See  Table II  for a statistical summary of these regions. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 4 
 
 Negative linear correlation between connectivity to the LH and CVLT-II percentage retention scores in three brain regions. A) The left inferior parietal lobule. B) The left precuneus/cingulate gyrus. C) The left middle frontal gyrus. Patients with MTS are shown in red, and patients without MTS are shown in blue as identified in  Table I . CVLT-II scores are unitless and beta values have arbitrary units. Linear regression was used to fit a line to the LTLE patient data for each plot. See  Table II  for a statistical summary of these regions.

B) Plot of the connectivity between the LH and the mid-right precuneus vs. connectivity between the LH and the left precuneus for LTLE patients. We used linear regression to fit a line to the LTLE patient data. The patients were divided into three categories based on their CVLT-II percentage retention score.

 M = male, F = female, R = right, L = left, MTS = mesial temporal sclerosis. CVLT-II retention score is the relative amount of information, relative to the learning trial, that was stored over time during the delay period of 20 minutes; see text for more description of this test. SPS = simple partial seizure, CPS = complex partial seizure, SGTC = secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizure. 
 
 
 * 
 In these two patients the MRI scan revealed no MTS, however post surgery analysis revealed MTS in both patients. 
 
 
 ** 
 This patient underwent mesial temporal resective surgery and was seizure free post surgery.
