 Episodic memory is associated with the encoding and retrieval of context
information, and with a subjective sense of re-experiencing past events. The neural
correlates of episodic retrieval have been extensively studied using fMRI, leading to the
identification of a “general recollection network” including medial
temporal, parietal, and prefrontal regions. However, in these studies, it is difficult to
disentangle the effects of context retrieval from recollection. In the present study, we
used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine the extent to which the
recruitment of regions in the recollection network is contingent on context reinstatement.
Participants were scanned during a cued recognition test for target words from encoded
sentences. Studied target words were preceded by either a cue word studied in the same
sentence (thus congruent with encoding context), or a cue word studied in a different
sentence (thus incongruent with encoding context). Converging fMRI results from
independently-defined regions of interest and whole-brain analysis showed regional
specificity in the recollection network. Activity in hippocampus and parahippocampal
cortex was specifically increased during successful retrieval following congruent context
cues, whereas parietal and prefrontal components of the general recollection network were
associated with confident retrieval irrespective of contextual congruency. Our findings
implicate medial temporal regions in the retrieval of semantic context, contributing to,
but dissociable from, recollective experience. 
 
 
 
 
 Introduction 
 Episodic memory, the ability to re-experience a past event, can be distinguished
from other forms of memory on the basis of two characteristics. One is the processing of
context information, such as temporal, spatial, perceptual, or other situational details of
an event ( Tulving, 1983 ;  1985 ). The other is “recollective experience”
( Tulving, 2002 ), which is associated with a
subjective sense that an event occurred in one’s personal past. Certainly, these two
factors are closely entwined, as the subjective experience of recollection depends upon
retrieving some aspect of the context in which a past event was encoded. The reinstatement
of encoding context in support of this subjective experience may be why recollection-based
memory decisions are typically reported with very high levels of confidence ( Yonelinas, 2001 ). 
 Typically, context is operationalized in terms of multiple characteristics (see
 Ranganath, 2010a ;  Mayes, Meudell, & Pickering, 1985 ;  Nadel,
2008 )—for instance, context includes information that is processed in the
background, relative to material that is the target of current processing. Context
information is also temporally extended, relative to item information. For example, when
reading text, a word is typically encoded in the context of a sentence, such that the
meaning of the word is integrated with a discourse representation that has been built up
over time ( Kintsch, 1988 ). Many theories propose that
recollective experience is a process by which contextual information is integrated,
attributed to a source, and framed in a first-person perspective ( Johnson, Hashtroudi, & Lindsay, 1993 ;  Moscovitch, 1995 ;  Ranganath,
2010b ;  Schacter, Norman, & Koutstaal,
1998 ;  Tulving, 1985 ). 
 One demonstration of the interplay between context processing and retrieval
processing in episodic memory is the encoding specificity principle ( Tulving & Thomson, 1973 ), which states that reinstating the
context of a past episode can facilitate retrieval of items studied in that context and,
conversely, that an inappropriate context cue can impede retrieval even if the cue is
semantically related to the target item. For example, when two words are studied together at
encoding, re-presenting one of the words at retrieval helps to reinstate the encoding
context and cues recognition of the other word even more effectively than presentation of a
strong semantic associate ( Tulving & Thomson,
1971 ). Semantic associations among stimuli have also been used to manipulate
contextual congruency between encoding and retrieval. When noun homonyms are modified with
adjectives within sentences to bias semantic interpretation (e.g., “strawberry
jam”), later recognition is impaired for nouns encountered in the context of a
different adjective at retrieval (e.g., “traffic jam”), relative to
reinstatement of the same encoding context ( Light &
Carter-Sobell, 1970 ). These findings suggest that the construction of semantic
context during discourse processing can play a potent role in shaping episodic memories. 
 It is clear that successful episodic retrieval is associated with both the
activation of context information and in the integration of context information in a manner
that gives rise to recollective experience, but less is understood about the degree to which
these two factors may be supported independently in the brain. Medial temporal lobe (MTL)
regions, in particular the hippocampus (HC), have long been the focus of research on the
neural substrates of episodic memory ( Scoville & Milner,
1957 ;  Squire, 1992 ). Neuropsychological
studies additionally identified the importance of prefrontal cortex (PFC) for episodic
memory ( Shimamura, 1995 ;  Wheeler, Stuss, & Tulving, 1995 ), and more recently,
neuroimaging studies have revealed activity in parietal cortex – both laterally, in
a ventral posterior region in the vicinity of the angular gyrus (AnG), and medially, in
retrosplenial or posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) – during episodic memory retrieval
( Cabeza, 2008 ;  Shimamura, 2011 ;  Vilberg & Rugg, 2008 ;
 Wagner, Shannon, Kahn, & Buckner, 2005 ).
Collectively, the involvement of MTL, medial PFC, AnG, and PCC regions has come to be
recognized as a “general recollection network”, such that activation in this
network is reliably increased during retrieval of contextual information ( Hayama, Vilberg, & Rugg, 2012 ;  Johnson & Rugg, 2007 ;  Rugg & Vilberg,
2013 ). However, the different roles assigned to different brain areas within the
network are unclear. 
 There is reason to believe that some components of the general recollection network
may be critical for context processing while others may contribute to recollective
experience. Although not yet established in fMRI studies, hints at functional dissociations
have been observed in the selective deficits of neuropsychological patients. For instance,
patients with relatively selective HC damage exhibit deficits in recollection-based
recognition ( Quamme, Yonelinas, Widaman, Kroll, &
Sauvé, 2004 ;  Vann et al., 2009 ) and
deficits in memory for contextual information associated with items ( Mayes et al., 1992 ). In contrast, patients with lateral parietal
lesions often report impairments in the subjective experience of recollection, yet can
perform normally on tests of source memory and associative memory that require contextual
information ( Berryhill, Drowos, & Olson, 2009 ;
 Davidson et al., 2008 ;  Simons et al., 2008 ). 
 The “Binding of Items and Context” (BIC) model of MTL function
( Diana, Yonelinas, & Ranganath, 2007 ;  Eichenbaum, Yonelinas, & Ranganath, 2007 ;  Ranganath, 2010a ) provides a framework for understanding
the role of HC and other brain regions that might support contextual influences on episodic
memory. According to BIC and related models ( Davachi,
2006 ;  Eacott and Gaffan, 2005 ;  Montaldi & Mayes, 2010 ), different MTL subregions
represent different aspects of an event—that is, the perirhinal cortex (PRC)
represents item information whereas the parahippocampal cortex (PHC) represents context
information. The HC, in turn, is involved in binding items and context together ( Eichenbaum, Yonelinas, & Ranganath, 2007 ;  Ranganath, 2010a ). A critical part of the BIC framework
is that it only assumes a role for HC and PHC in the retrieval of contextual details,
whereas cortical targets of these areas, such as regions in parietal and prefrontal cortex,
are thought to support the constructive processes associated with the subjective experience
of recollection ( Ranganath, 2010a ). 
 In meta-analyses of fMRI studies, activity in HC and PHC ( Diana et al., 2007 ;  Spaniol et al.,
2009 ), and also AnG ( Spaniol et al., 2009 ;
 Vilberg & Rugg, 2008 ) has been associated with
the factor of retrieval processing representing subjective recollection. However, in these
studies, subjective recollection could not be separated from the factor of context
processing. Sensitivity to context reinstatement can be assessed independently from
recollective experience by manipulating the congruency of cues preceding target items on a
recognition test. Previous fMRI studies examining cue-target congruency at encoding ( Park & Rugg, 2007 ) and retrieval ( Ciaramelli, Grady, Levine, Ween, & Moscovitch, 2010 ) have noted
the involvement of dorsal posterior parietal regions associated with attentional effects.
These studies did not address, however, whether the factors of retrieval processing and
context processing are separable within the general recollection network. 
 In the present study, we used event-related fMRI to identify the brain regions
involved in retrieval of semantic context and to disentangle context-related effects from
activity more generally related to retrieval success. Prior to scanning, participants
encoded 270 sentences, each of which contained a pair of semantically-related words. We
predicted that during discourse processing, participants would construct a semantic context
linking the words in each sentence. The effects of context reinstatement were then examined
during a scanned retrieval phase, in which participants made recognition confidence
decisions on each trial for a target word preceded by a studied cue word. On
“Congruent Cue” trials, the target was preceded by a semantically-related
cue that had been studied in the same sentence, whereas on “Incongruent Cue”
trials, the target was preceded by a semantically-related cue that had been studied in a
different sentence. Because the semantic associative strength between cue and target items
was matched across trial types, the effects of cueing at retrieval depended upon integration
of semantic context at encoding, rather than pre-existing semantic associations to the
target word. 
 Based on the encoding specificity principle, we predicted that recognition of
studied target words should be facilitated on trials when the cue word was studied in the
same sentence, thus reinstating the same encoding context at retrieval. In addition to
characterizing behavioral effects, we sought to uncover regional specificity within the
general recollection network. We predicted that HC and PHC would support contextual
influences on episodic retrieval, and as such, should be disproportionately engaged during
successful retrieval on trials when encoding context was reinstated. Based on evidence from
neuropsychological and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies indicating that
parietal areas may support the subjective experience of successful retrieval, rather than
the recovery of context information ( Davidson et al.,
2008 ;  Simons, Peers, Mazuz, Berryhill, & Olson,
2010 ;  Yazar, Bergström, & Simons,
submitted ), we predicted that activity in parietal areas, and particularly the left
AnG, should be associated with confident retrieval irrespective of contextual
congruency. 
 
 
 Method 
 
 Participants 
 Twenty-two healthy, right-handed adults (19–32 yrs old; 11 female) were
recruited from the University of California at Davis (UCD) community. The research
protocol was approved by the UCD Institutional Review Board, and all participants provided
written informed consent and were paid for their participation. Data from three
participants were excluded from analysis due to chance memory performance or excessive
head movement. Results are therefore reported for the remaining 19 participants. 
 
 
 Materials 
 Stimuli consisted of 180 sets of five words arranged as overlapping
semantically-related word pairs (e.g., CARD-ACE, CARD-DECK, DECK-WOOD, WOOD-CHOP), with
words matched for length ( M  = 5.6 letters) and Kucera-Francis
frequency ( M  = 46.9), and pairs matched for forward associative
strength (FAS;  M  = 0.06) derived from the University of South
Florida Free Association Norms ( Nelson, McEvoy, &
Schreiber, 1998 ). To minimize the potentially confounding effect of implicit
associative responses on memory ( Underwood, 1965 ),
care was taken to exclude highly associated word pairs (FAS > 0.25). 
 From these stimuli, two sets of 270 sentences were constructed as encoding
materials, with each sentence containing one pair of semantically-related words (i.e.,
“critical words”, which were always separated by two words that were not
functionally related). For example, the sentences “I knew the high CARD was the
ACE in my hand” and “The WOOD on the DECK had warped over the
years” were produced from the stimulus set referenced above [critical
words capitalized here for illustrative purposes only]. The sets were matched for
sentence length ( M  = 11.9 words). Each stimulus set also produced
three possible cue-target pairs as retrieval materials. Within each pair, the cue item was
always one of the two critical words; the target item was then either 1) the other
critical word that appeared in the same sentence at encoding (e.g., cue = ACE,
target = CARD), 2) another semantically-related word that had appeared in a
different sentence at encoding (e.g., cue = DECK, target = CARD), or 3)
another semantically-related but unpresented word (e.g., cue = WOOD, target
= CHOP). Two counterbalanced orders ensured that no critical words were presented
more than once at encoding and no target item was presented more than once at retrieval.
For example, although both of the sentences referenced above may have been presented to
the same participant at encoding, at retrieval participants in one condition would
encounter ACE-CARD (cue and target items studied in the same, or
 congruent , sentence context) while participants in the other condition
would encounter DECK-CARD (cue and target items studied in different, or
 incongruent , sentence contexts). Care was also taken to minimize
semantic overlap across sentences for non-cue and non-target words. 
 
 
 Design and procedure 
 The experiment began with an incidental encoding phase, outside of the scanner,
during which 270 sentences were presented sequentially on a computer screen. Each sentence
appeared for 4 s, and participants were instructed to rate its pleasantness on a 6-point
scale (from “dislike a lot” to “like a lot”) with a
button-press response. Participants first completed a brief practice session to become
familiar with the response format, but they were not told that their memory would later be
tested. Subsequently, the retrieval phase was performed in the scanner, with 270 trials
divided into six functional runs. As shown in  Fig. 1 ,
each trial began with a cue word in lower-case letters (1 s), followed by a fixation cross
(3 s) and then a target word in upper-case letters (1 s). Participants were instructed to
make a recognition confidence judgment for the target word on a 6-point scale (from
“sure old” to “sure new”) with a button-press response.
Each run contained 15 trials from each of three trial types: 1)  Congruent Cue
(CC) , in which the cue and target words were studied in same sentence context,
2)  Incongruent Cue (IC) , in which the cue and target words were studied
in different sentence contexts, or 3)  Foil , in which a studied cue word
was followed by an unstudied target word (see  Fig.
1 ). Participants were told that the appearance of each lower-case (cue) word
signaled the start of a trial, but they were not told about the congruency manipulation,
and task instructions emphasized responding to only the upper-case (target) word on each
trial. Trial order was unique across runs and optimized using optseq2 ( Dale, 1999 ), with the intertrial interval varying between 3 and
13 s ( M  = 5 s). 
 
 
 MRI acquisition and processing 
 MRI data were acquired on a 3T Siemens Skyra scanner at the UCD MRI Facility for
Integrative Neurosciences. A gradient echo EPI sequence (repetition time (TR) =
2000 ms; echo time (TE) = 25 ms; flip angle = 90°; field of view
(FOV) = 205 mm; 64x64 matrix; 34 slices, interleaved; 3.2 mm isotropic voxels) was
used to obtain functional images sensitive to BOLD contrast. A total of 232 volumes were
collected in each functional run, with the first 4 volumes discarded to allow for signal
equilibration. A gradient echo field map sequence (TR = 614 ms; TE 1 
= 4.92 ms; TE 2  = 7.38 ms; flip angle = 60°; FOV
= 256 mm; 80x80 matrix) was acquired prior to the functional runs. An MPRAGE
sequence (TR = 1800 ms; TE = 2.96 ms; flip angle = 7°; FOV
= 256 mm; 256x256 matrix) was used to obtain high-resolution T1-weighted
anatomical images at the end of the scanning session. 
 Data were preprocessed using SPM8 ( http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm ). Functional images were slice-time
corrected using sinc interpolation, realigned and unwarped using the field map parameters,
normalized to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using affine and non-linear
transformations, resliced into 3 mm isotropic voxels, and spatially smoothed using a 6 mm
isotropic full-width at half maximum Gaussian kernel. For three participants who had
errors in field map acquisition, realignment was instead performed using a standard
six-parameter, rigid-body transformation. 
 
 
 Analysis 
 Event-related BOLD responses were analyzed using the general linear model (GLM)
implemented in SPM8, with separate regressors modeling cue and target period activation as
a function of trial type (CC/IC) and retrieval success (SureOldHits/OtherHits/Misses).
Covariates of interest were constructed by convolving vectors of predicted neural activity
with a canonical hemodynamic response function. To account for residual variance due to
head movement, realignment parameters were included in the model as covariates of no
interest. First-level analysis was performed using the GLM with a temporal high-pass
filter applied to remove frequencies below 0.005 Hz. 
 To examine task effects within components of the general recollection network,
independent functional regions of interest (ROIs) were defined using a meta-analysis map
generated with the search term “recollection” in the online NeuroSynth
database ( Yarkoni, Poldrack, Nichols, Van Essen, &
Wager, 2011 ). Predominant clusters located in PCC (center of mass [x, y,
z] = −1, −52, 28), mPFC (−6, 45, 19), bilateral
AnG (LAnG: −44, −64, 36; RAnG: 44, −72, 32), and bilateral MTL
were selected for ROI analysis (see  Fig. 2 ), on the
basis of the recollection network regions described by  Rugg and Vilberg (2013) . Because the MTL clusters were large enough to encompass
several anatomical subregions, they were divided into smaller functional-anatomical ROIs.
Bilateral HC clusters (L HC: −26, −21, −14; R HC: 29, −20,
−13) and bilateral PHC clusters (L PHC: −26, −30, −17; R
PHC: 25, −31, −14) were identified within the MTL functional ROIs by
computing their intersection with HC and PHC anatomical ROIs from the LONI Probabilistic
Brain Atlas ( Shattuck et al., 2008 ). Mean parameter
estimates were extracted from the mask images of each recollection network ROI, for each
participant, and entered into contextual congruency (CC, IC) x retrieval success
(SureOldHits, Misses) factorial ANOVAs. For exploratory whole-brain analyses, to confirm
the reliability of ROI results, contrast images created for each participant were entered
into second-level one-sample  t  tests. Significant regions of activation
were identified using an uncorrected threshold of  p  < .001, with a
minimum cluster size of 5 contiguous voxels. 
 
 
 
 Results 
 
 Behavioral data 
 Based upon the encoding specificity principle, we expected that recognition
accuracy would be higher, and response times would be faster, when cue and target words
were studied in the same sentence, thus reinstating the same encoding context at
retrieval. Analysis of responses to the studied target words showed that contextual
congruency was indeed effective in promoting successful memory retrieval. Overall
recognition accuracy (all “old” responses, collapsed across confidence
level) was higher for CC ( M  = .70) than IC ( M 
= .61) trials [ t (18) = 5.59,  p 
< .001], indicating that the reinstatement of semantic context with congruent
cues facilitated recognition of studied targets. As shown in  Table 1 , the effect was driven by high-confidence responses: the
average proportion of hits receiving “sure old” judgments was greater for
CC than IC trials [ t (18) = 2.67,  p  <
.02]. Incorporating the rate of false alarms to foils ( M 
= .39),  d ′ statistics were also higher for CC
( M  = .84) than IC ( M  = .59) trials
[ t (18) = 5.34,  p  < .001].
RTs were faster for hits on CC ( M  = 1,674 ms) than IC
( M  = 1,818 ms) trials [ t (18) =
3.84,  p  < .005], likewise consistent with a benefit from
cue-target congruency. 
 Estimates of recollection and familiarity were derived from receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves plotting the proportion of hits versus false alarms for each
point on the recognition confidence scale ( Yonelinas,
1994 ), shown in  Fig. 3 . Higher parameter
estimates from CC than IC trials were found for both recollection
[ t (18) = 2.40,  p  < .03] and
familiarity [ t (18) = 3.79,  p  <
.01], corroborating the accuracy and RT results reported above. In ROC analysis,
chance performance would fall along the diagonal, but target recognition was significantly
higher than chance in both conditions ( p s < .001 in one-sample
 t -tests), as can be seen in the shape of the CC and IC curves. 
 
 
 fMRI data 
 We analyzed data from ROIs corresponding to components of the general
recollection network ( Rugg & Vilberg, 2013 ),
defined based on a meta-analysis map for the search term “recollection” in
the NeuroSynth database (see Method section). For each ROI, mean parameter estimates were
entered into contextual congruency (CC, IC) x retrieval success (SureOldHits, Misses)
factorial ANOVAs (see  Table 2 ). Firstly, as shown
in  Fig. 4 , the main effect of retrieval success
(SureOldHits > Misses) on target-period activity was significant in L HC, R HC, L PHC,
L AnG, and mPFC ROIs (all  p -values < .05), and marginally significant
in PCC ( p  = .09), consistent with numerous findings from previous
fMRI studies of episodic memory ( Rugg & Vilberg,
2013 ;  Spaniol et al., 2009 ). Secondly,
regional specificity was found in sensitivity to context reinstatement. In bilateral AnG,
mPFC, and PCC, there was no reliable interaction between retrieval success and contextual
congruency ( Fig. 4 , bottom row) 1 . In contrast, the main effect of retrieval success was
qualified by an interaction with contextual congruency in L HC and R HC
( p -values < .05). In these ROIs, the simple effect of retrieval
success was significant on CC trials ( p -values < .001) but not IC
trials ( Fig. 4 , top row). In L PHC, the retrieval
success x congruency interaction was marginally significant ( p  =
.06), and simple effects showed the same pattern. 
 We next conducted exploratory whole-brain analyses to confirm the reliability of
the ROI results. A retrieval success contrast of target-period activity (SureOldHits >
Misses) revealed activation in the general recollection network, including peaks in left
AnG, mPFC, PCC, and bilateral HC (see  Fig. 5A ). The
interaction between retrieval success and contextual congruency on target-period activity
([CC SureOldHits > CC Misses] > [IC SureOldHits > IC
Misses]) also identified MTL peaks: in bilateral PHC and L HC, the retrieval
success effect was larger for CC targets than IC targets (see  Fig. 5B ), consistent with the ROI analyses implicating these
regions in the retrieval of semantic context. Results from the interaction contrast are
summarized in  Table 3 . MTL regions were the only
components of the general recollection network to show activation in the whole-brain
retrieval success x congruency interaction; outside of the general recollection network,
the interaction contrast identified additional peaks in left orbitofrontal cortex (ventral
inferior frontal gyrus), right frontal operculum (precentral gyrus), and right insula. 
 
 
 
 Discussion 
 In the present study, we investigated brain areas associated with the facilitation
of episodic memory retrieval through contextual congruency. Behavioral results showed the
predicted effects of encoding specificity, with higher recognition accuracy and faster
response times on trials when the semantic context from encoding was reinstated at
retrieval. Within the general recollection network ( Rugg
& Vilberg, 2013 ), the MTL components (HC and PHC) were disproportionately
associated with successful episodic retrieval when context was reinstated, whereas retrieval
success effects were independent of context in the parietal and prefrontal components (AnG,
PCC, and mPFC). 
 Numerous fMRI studies of episodic memory have contrasted activity associated with
“remember” judgments or high confidence ratings against activity associated
with “know” judgments or low confidence ratings. These contrasts
consistently reveal activation in AnG, HC, and PHC ( Diana et
al., 2007 ;  Spaniol et al., 2009 ;  Vilberg & Rugg, 2008 ). Despite this consistency,
there has been ongoing debate about the extent to which such effects reflect processes
pertinent to the subjective experience of remembering ( Aggleton & Brown, 1999 ;  Yazar,
Bergström, & Simons, 2012 ;  Yonelinas,
Aly, Wang, & Koen, 2010 ), the access to contextual information about an
encoding episode ( Davachi, 2006 ;  Kafkas & Montaldi, 2012 ;  Montaldi & Mayes, 2010 ;  Ranganath,
2010a ), or merely the retrieval of information about a strongly encoded item ( Smith, Wixted, & Squire, 2011 ;  Wais, 2011 ). The present results suggest that the answer varies for
different regions within the recollection network. 
 Our findings indicate that, for HC (and to a lesser extent, left PHC), context
reinstatement is a critical determinant of recruitment during memory retrieval.
Target-period activity in HC was significantly higher for confident hits than misses on
congruent cue trials, as compared with confidently recognized items that were preceded by an
incongruent cue. This result might seem surprising in light of many reports that link
hippocampal activity with recollective experience. However, there is a growing body of
evidence to suggest that HC contributes to relational memory even when recollection fails.
 Hannula and Ranganath (2009)  used fMRI with
concurrent eye-tracking and found that HC activity during presentation of a contextual cue
predicted subsequent viewing of the item associated with that context, even when explicit
recognition decisions were incorrect. Similarly,  Yu et al.
(2012)  contrasted recollection-based “remember” responses and
familiarity-based “know” responses during a source memory test and found
that HC activity reflected the amount of context information retrieved, rather than
recollective experience. Thus, it may be that HC constitutes a component of the general
recollection network because its activation typically correlates with recollection, but it
is not necessary for the conscious experience of recollection. Our findings suggest that HC
recruitment supports the factor of context processing, contributing to but dissociable from
recollective experience. 
 The involvement of HC and PHC in context processing is consistent with accounts
that emphasize the different kinds of representations carried by MTL subregions ( Davachi, 2006 ;  Eichenbaum
et al., 2007 ;  Montaldi & Mayes, 2010 ;
 Ranganath, 2010a ). For instance, the BIC model
( Eichenbaum et al., 2007 ;  Ranganath, 2010a ) assigns the representation of context information
to PHC and the binding of item and context information to HC. Recent work has extended the
context processing role of PHC beyond spatial and temporal context to include cognitive
context ( Diana, Yonelinas, & Ranganath, 2012 ;
 2013 ; see also  Wang, Yonelinas, & Ranganath, 2013 ), concordant with our findings that PHC is
sensitive to reinstatement of semantic context. Our results are less consistent with
accounts that suggest a role for the hippocampus in retrieval of information about the
attributes of items (e.g.,  Wixted & Squire,
2011 ). Even when considering only highly confident recognition hits, presumably
associated with “strong” memories, HC activity was preferentially related to
retrieval when the encoding context was reinstated. Although it is possible that the
hippocampus may carry some information about items, this information is likely to be
integrated with information about the context in which the item was previously encountered
( see Hsieh et al., 2014 ). 
 Unlike what was observed in the MTL, activation in left AnG was sensitive to
successful retrieval, independent of context. That is, activity in this region was greater
on trials when studied targets were confidently remembered as opposed to forgotten, but was
not affected by contextual congruency. Neuroimaging studies consistently report activity in
posterior parietal cortex (PPC) associated with successful episodic retrieval, a pattern
which has been variously attributed to accumulation of mnemonic evidence ( Wagner et al., 2005 ), attention to the contents of memory ( Cabeza, 2008 ), temporary storage of episodic
representations ( Vilberg & Rugg, 2008 ), or
integration of multimodal episodic details ( Shimamura,
2011 ). When participants’ subjective memory reports are assessed,
activation peaks are frequently localized to dorsal PPC for familiarity-based recognition,
and ventral PPC including AnG for recollection-based recognition ( Hutchinson, Uncapher, & Wagner, 2009 ;  Spaniol et al., 2009 ;  Vilberg &
Rugg, 2008 ). While the processing of contextual information is one factor that
contributes to recollection, AnG activity has also been found to correlate with episodic
retrieval even for falsely recognized items ( Kahn,
2004 ;  Wheeler & Buckner, 2003 ),
suggesting that it supports the factor of subjective recollection. Moreover, selective
deficits in the subjective experience of recollection have been documented in patients with
lateral parietal lesions ( Berryhill et al., 2009 ;
 Davidson et al., 2008 ;  Simons et al., 2008 ;  2010 )
and induced in healthy participants via TMS ( Yazar et al.,
submitted ). Our findings are consistent with evidence of parietal contributions to
retrieval success or recollective experience, independent of context processing. 
 Within the literature on PPC contributions to episodic memory, a few fMRI studies
have examined effects of cue-target congruency.  Ciaramelli et
al. (2010)  adopted this approach to test the Attention-to-Memory hypothesis ( Cabeza, 2008 ), which proposes that attention to the
contents of memory involves bottom-up processes, mediated by ventral PPC, and top-down
processes, mediated by dorsal PPC. Top-down attentional processes triggered by a relevant,
or congruent, cue would be expected to benefit retrieval of an associated target.  Ciaramelli et al. (2010)  scanned participants during a
cued recognition test for target items from word pairs that were studied at encoding. A
significant brain-behavior correlation was found in dorsal PPC for the contrast of targets
preceded by studied cues vs. no cue, indicating that engagement of top-down attention at
retrieval predicted the degree to which congruent cues facilitated target recognition.  Park and Rugg (2007)  observed similar attentional effects
at encoding for stimuli that subsequently benefitted from congruent presentation.
Participants were scanned as they studied items presented either as words or pictures, then
performed a recognition test in which target items were either congruent (same material as
encoding, e.g., word-word or picture-picture) or incongruent (different material).
Material-independent congruency effects for retrieval success, where activity was greater
for subsequently recognized congruent items than incongruent items, were found in dorsal
PPC. While these studies focused on attentional effects governed by dorsal PPC, showing that
contextual congruency influences activity in regions supporting top-down attention, the
present study emphasized memory effects linked to ventral PPC and indicated that AnG
recruitment operates independently of context. Our results suggest a role for AnG in
translating retrieved information into confident recognition decisions, in contrast to MTL
regions which appear to be more engaged during context reinstatement. 
 The present study collected confidence ratings instead of reports of subjective
recollection from participants, an approach which suited the aim of our research but has its
limitations. For example, the fMRI analyses evaluated retrieval success with highly
confident hits (SureOldHits) contrasted against all misses. Although it is highly likely
that many of these items were recollected ( Yonelinas,
2001 ), it is possible that some high-confidence hits were driven by familiarity.
Additionally, due to insufficient numbers of trials, it was not possible to separate
confidence levels on miss trials. Notably, most models of recognition memory consider
guesses (i.e., low-confidence misses) and higher-confidence misses as varying along a
continuum of strength of evidence. Thus, there is reason to believe that separating guesses
from other misses would not reveal qualitatively different results. Importantly, although
mixing no-memory and weak-memory trials in the Misses bin or diluting recollection-based
memory decisions in the SureOldHits bin could reduce sensitivity to detect any effects,
neither factor would bias our analyses to achieve the predicted result. 
 In summary, we found widespread main effects of retrieval success within the
general recollection network, as expected, but regionally specific activation in HC and PHC
for the interaction between retrieval success and the reinstatement of semantic context.
Thus, our findings indicate that context processing can be at least partially dissociated
from subjective recollection. The pattern in HC and PHC supports our hypothesis based upon
the encoding specificity principle, as target-period activity was greater on trials when the
cue word was congruent with encoding context. The context-independent effects of retrieval
success in AnG, PCC, and mPFC suggest that these components may implement processes that are
more closely related to the subjective experience of remembering. Accordingly, it is likely
that the different components of the general recollection network work together, playing
different, but complementary, roles in facilitating episodic memory retrieval.

 To examine whether the results would be affected by restricting the extent of these
relatively large ROIs (as compared to smaller MTL subregions), we created 10mm sphere ROIs
around the center of mass coordinates for the AnG, mPFC, and PCC ROIs. ANOVAs using
parameter estimates extracted from the spheres replicated the results using full ROIs: the
congruency x retrieval success interaction was not significant for any of the parietal or
frontal components of the general recollection network (all  F s <
1).

 Experimental design. 
 Prior to scanning, participants encoded a series of sentences, each of which contained a
pair of semantically-related words (underlined for illustrative purposes only). During
scanning, they made recognition confidence decisions for three trial types, all consisting
of a target word preceded by a studied cue word. The cue and target words were studied in
the same sentence context on Congruent Cue (CC) trials and in different sentence contexts
on Incongruent Cue (IC) trials. On Foil trials, the cue word was followed by an unstudied
target word.

 Independently-defined general recollection network ROIs. 
 Functional ROIs defined using a reverse inference meta-analysis map for the search term
“recollection” in the NeuroSynth database ( Yarkoni et al., 2011 ) include PCC (red), mPFC (cyan), left AnG (green), right
AnG (blue), left HC (yellow), left PHC (orange), right HC (magenta), and right PHC
(purple). See text for center of mass coordinates. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 3 
 
 Recognition discriminability is higher following context reinstatement. 
 A: Aggregate recognition receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots are shown
separately for Congruent Cue trials (blue, solid lines) and Incongruent Cue trials (red,
dashed lines). Plots depict averaged hit and false alarm rates across different response
criteria. B: Average estimates of recollection and familiarity derived from ROC
curves. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 4 
 
 Parameter estimates extracted from general recollection network ROIs. 
 A–F: Main effects of retrieval success are found throughout the general
recollection network, where activity is greater for confident hits (solid bars) than for
misses (shaded bars). Sensitivity to context reinstatement is found only in MTL components
of the network (A–C), where retrieval success effects are greater on Congruent Cue
trials (blue) than Incongruent Cue trials (red). See  Table
2  for significance tests. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 5 
 
 Exploratory whole-brain analysis. 
 A: Retrieval success contrast shows significant regions of activation corresponding to
the general recollection network. B: Interaction of retrieval success and contextual
congruency shows greater retrieval success effects for Congruent Cue (CC) trials than
Incongruent Cue (IC) trials in bilateral PHC and L HC.
