 Adenosine A 2a  receptor antagonists reduce symptom severity in Parkinson disease (PD) and animal models. Rodent studies support the hypothesis that A 2a  antagonists produce this benefit by reducing the inhibitory output of the basal ganglia indirect pathway. One way to test this hypothesis in humans is to quantify regional pharmacodynamic responses with cerebral blood flow (CBF) imaging. That approach has also been proposed as a tool to accelerate pharmaceutical dose-finding, but has not yet been applied in humans to drugs in development. We successfully addressed both these aims with a perfusion MRI study of the novel adenosine A 2a  antagonist SYN115. 
 During a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 21 PD patients on levodopa but no agonists, we acquired pulsed arterial spin labeling MRI at the end of each treatment period. SYN115 produced a highly significant decrease in thalamic CBF, consistent with reduced pallidothalamic inhibition via the indirect pathway. Similar decreases occurred in cortical regions whose activity decreases with increased alertness and externally-focused attention, consistent with decreased self-reported sleepiness on SYN115. 
 Remarkably, we also derived quantitative pharmacodynamic parameters from the CBF responses to SYN115. These results suggested that the doses tested were on the low end of the effective dose range, consistent with clinical data reported separately. We conclude that (1) SYN115 enters the brain and exerts dose-dependent regional effects, (2) the most prominent of these effects is consistent with deactivation of the indirect pathway as predicted by preclinical studies; and (3) perfusion MRI can provide rapid, quantitative, clinically relevant dose-finding information for pharmaceutical development.

 Introduction 
 Measuring the sensitivity of a biological system to a drug is of significant interest not only as a topic of basic research, but also as a practical tool for pharmaceutical development, since dose-finding studies in humans are crucially important yet expensive and often take months or years. New approaches to measuring pharmacodynamic response are eagerly sought. One approach has been to image the organ of interest while applying pharmacological stimuli (rather than cognitive tasks or sensory stimuli). Pharmacological challenge imaging is especially relevant for studies of the brain ( Herscovitch, 2001 ;  Wise and Tracey, 2006 ;  Lawrence and Mackey, 2008 ). 
 Pharmacological challenge imaging was applied very early in preclinical studies of the action of antiparkinsonian drugs ( McCulloch and Harper, 1977 ;  McCulloch et al., 1980b ), and further studies clarified the neuronal pathways that led to the effects on cerebral blood flow (CBF) or metabolism and their alteration with parkinsonism or anesthestics ( McCulloch, 1982 ;  McCulloch et al., 1980a ;  Crosby et al., 1982 ;  Trugman, 1995 ). This approach was extended to  in vivo  neuroimaging in humans ( Grasby et al., 1993 ;  Hershey et al., 1998 ;  Black et al., 2005 ) and other primates ( Perlmutter et al., 1993 ;  Black et al., 1997 ;  2000 ;  2002a ;  2002b ;  Hershey et al., 2000 ). Even so, few pharmacological challenge studies produced dose-response information ( Grasby et al., 1993 ;  Perlmutter et al., 1993 ;  Black et al., 1997 ;  2000 ;  2002a ;  2002b ;  Hershey et al., 2000 ;  Ireland et al., 2005 ;  Kofke et al., 2007 ;  Bruns et al., 2009 ), and none provided quantitative characterization of a dose-response curve. 
 For technical reasons BOLD-sensitive fMRI is difficult to apply to pharmacological challenge imaging ( Iannetti and Wise, 2007 ), though several labs have performed pharmacological challenge fMRI (phMRI) in nonhuman species or for drugs with a short half-life ( Chen et al., 1996 ;  1997 ;  2001 ;  Ireland et al., 2005 ;  Borsook et al., 2007 ;  Bruns et al., 2009 ). Blood flow MRI does not share the technical limitations of BOLD-sensitive methods, and it builds on the successes of blood flow PET in producing useful pharmacodynamic results ( Herscovitch, 2001 ;  Leslie and James, 2001 ). Recent studies have demonstrated the validity of applying perfusion MRI in humans to study existing drugs ( Bruns et al., 2009 ;  Borsook et al., 2007 ;  Kofke et al., 2007 ;  MacIntosh et al., 2008 ). However, practical and physiological issues have delayed useful applications; we have not located a published report of human pharmacological challenge perfusion MRI successfully applied to an investigational new drug. 
 A 2a  receptor antagonists are being studied eagerly as potential alternative treatments for PD ( Fuxe et al., 2007 ). A 2a  receptors co-localize on striatopallidal neurons with dopamine D2 and D3 receptors, which inhibit the so-called indirect basal ganglia pathway from striatum to thalamus via globus pallidus pars externa, subthalamic nucleus (STN) and internal pallidum ( Strömberg et al., 2000 ;  Torvinen et al., 2005 ). A 2a  antagonists produce some of the same biological effects as dopamine D2 and D3 agonists ( Tanganelli et al., 2004 ), yet it is not known whether they also inhibit the indirect pathway, nor which “downstream” cortical and subcortical regions of human brain are most sensitive to A 2a  antagonism. 
 We used perfusion MRI to answer these scientific questions and to inform development of a new A 2a  receptor antagonist, SYN115. This work was presented in part at the annual meetings of the Society for Neuroscience, the American Academy of Neurology, and the Movement Disorders Society ( Dickerson et al., 2009 ;  Black et al., 2010a , b ). 
 
 
 Methods 
 
 Regulatory Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consent 
 This study was approved by the Washington University Human Research Protection Office. Written documentation of informed consent was obtained in advance from each subject. Levodopa and SYN115 were given under U.S. FDA Investigational New Drug application # 78,230. 
 The study was conducted at the Center for Clinical Imaging Research and the NeuroClinical Research Unit of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT00605553). 
 
 
 Study participants 
 Twenty-one nondemented, nondepressed adults age 40–75 with mild idiopathic PD ( Hoehn and Yahr (1967)  stages 1–3), treated with a stable dose of levodopa but no dopamine agonists, participated in the study. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are reported elsewhere (Black KJ, Campbell MC, Dickerson W, Koller JM, Chung S, Bandak SI: A randomized, controlled, clinical study of the adenosine antagonist SYN115 in Parkinson disease; presented at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, 14 April 2010). 
 
 
 Study protocol 
 In this crossover study, subjects were randomly assigned to one of two treatment sequences: those assigned to Sequence 1 took SYN115 twice daily for a week, waited 1 week (washout period), then took a matching placebo twice daily for a week; those assigned to Sequence 2 participated in the reverse order (see  Figure 1 a ). Subjects and staff were blind to SYN115-placebo sequence assignment. In 14 subjects, each SYN115 dose during the active treatment week was 60mg, and in 12 subsequent subjects the dose was 20mg. Five subjects who participated in the 60mg-placebo segment later participated in the 20mg-placebo segment, for a total of 21 distinct subjects. 
 Subjects were evaluated on the last day of each treatment week (“scan days”) (see  Figure 1 b ). Subjects had abstained from food and all forms of caffeine since the preceding evening. On the morning of the scan day they did not take their usual antiparkinsonian medications, but they took the last dose of SYN115 or placebo at about 6a.m. After arrival at the imaging center, subjects took 200mg carbidopa by mouth and then underwent two sets of clinical and MRI assessments, once before and once during an infusion of levodopa. 
 The intravenous levodopa infusion was dosed so as to rapidly produce and then maintain a steady plasma concentration of 600ng/ml ( Gordon et al., 2007 ). The infusion was delivered through small-bore light-resistant Luer lock tubing (part #537235PS, Medex, Dublin, OH) from a Model 44 syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) inside an RF-shielded copper box (Shielding Resources Group, Inc., Tulsa, OK). The time-dependent infusion rate was controlled by custom software written in Java (Sun Microsystems, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) running on a small solid-state laptop computer (Eee PC 2G, Asus, Fremont, CA) connected to the pump’s serial port. The pump was powered through an uninterruptible power supply (battery backup) inside the copper box so that the pump box could be moved with the patient without interrupting the infusion. 
 All MRI and clinical assessments were repeated while the maintenance levodopa infusion continued, beginning at least 25 minutes after the levodopa infusion started,  i.e.  after ~4 times the distribution half-life (t ½ α ) of intravenous levodopa (Abraham N, Karimi M, Devine C, Black KJ: The human experience with intravenous levodopa. Presented at World Parkinson Congress, Washington, DC, 26 Feb 2006). Blood samples for measuring plasma levodopa concentrations were taken from an upper extremity vein contralateral to the infusion site after the second assessment battery of each day. 
 The timing of the clinical and fMRI assessments before and on levodopa was planned to approximately bracket the T max  of SYN115 (time to maximal plasma concentration) after chronic dosing. 
 
 
 Behavioral state during fMRI scans 
 Each assessment battery mentioned above included 8 perfusion MRI scans. Each perfusion scan was acquired during a single behavioral task condition: 2 scans while the subject fixated a central crosshair surrounded by a circular checkerboard pattern reversing at 8Hz, 2 scans while the subject performed a 2-back letter working memory task, and 4 control visual fixation scans with the crosshair but no checkerboard. The reversing checkerboard scans were done as a positive control for the ASL method so that if the study drug showed no activation we could test whether ASL, as implemented in this study, was adequately sensitive to changes in rCBF. 
 
 
 Quantification of plasma concentration of SYN115 
 SYN115 plasma concentrations were determined using a validated LC/MS/MS assay (Frontage Laboratories, Malvern, PA). The method employed protein precipitation of SYN115 from human plasma followed by HPLC separation and MS/MS detection, with a deuterated internal standard. Electrospray ionization and positive sample mode were used on an API 4000 and 5000 platform. All sample analysis runs used freshly prepared QC samples. The assay was validated in the concentration range of 10–10,000 ng/ml. 
 
 
 MRI methods 
 All MRI data were acquired on the Siemens 3.0T Tim Trio with matrix head coil. ASL images were acquired with the commercial Siemens pulsed arterial spin labeling (pASL) sequence ( Wang et al., 2003 ). with 15 echo-planar readout slices parallel to the bicommissural line, at center-to-center distance 6.0 mm, 64×64 voxels in plane with dimensions (3.4375mm) 2 , repetition time (TR) 2.6 sec, echo time (TE) 13.0 msec, and flip angle 90°. An M 0  image was followed by 31 tag-control pairs for a total acquisition time for each ASL “scan” of 2.73 min. Brain structure was assessed by averaging two mutually registered sagittal MP-RAGE acquisitions with voxel size (1.0mm) 3 , TR = 2.4 sec, TE = 3.08 msec, TI = 1000 msec, flip angle = 8°. 
 
 
 Creation of scaled CBF images 
 The 63 frames of the ASL run were rigidly aligned using a validated method ( Black et al., 2001 ) and summed to facilitate later alignment steps. Each frame was smoothed using a Gaussian filter with kernel measuring 7.35mm (FWHM), and cerebral blood flow (CBF) was computed in each voxel for each tag-control pair ( Wang et al., 2003 ). The summed within-run-aligned EPI images were mutually aligned within each subject and summed, and the resulting image was affine registered to a target image in Talairach and Tournoux space made using validated methods from the structural MR images from these subjects ( Black et al., 2004 ). From this registration, the 31 tag-control-pair CBF images were resampled into atlas space using matrix multiplication to avoid multiple resampling steps, and averaged to create a single atlas-registered CBF image for each ASL run. One such image is shown in  Supplementary Figure 6 . 
 Only those voxels were analyzed that were represented in every EPI image in every subject. The combined volume of these voxels was 1,231ml ( Supplementary Figure 7 ). Global or whole-brain mean CBF (gCBF) was computed across these voxels, so that gCBF was computed from the same brain region in every scan in every subject. However, for a given scan, voxels whose value was <20 or >120 ml hg −1  min −1  ( i.e.  physiologically unreasonable values) were excluded from this mean. 
 Regional analyses must account for possible changes in gCBF with drug, to avoid incorrectly interpreting results ( Black et al., 2002b ). Thus all SYN115-CL01 analyses examining  regional  CBF removed the gCBF effect by scaling all input images multiplicatively so that the global mean CBF for every image was 50 ml hg −1  min −1 . This conventional approach to blood flow imaging was pre-specified for this study from the outset. Thus any decreases in regional CBF represent changes beyond that which could be explained by the overall change in whole-brain average, or global, CBF. 
 
 
 Statistical methods 
 Our lab’s standard approach to pharmacological activation analysis is to perform a voxelwise statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis to identify regional changes, using globally scaled CBF images only from placebo and the highest dose of drug ( Black et al., 2004 ). This approach reduces the multiplicity of possible comparisons by assuming that the drug effects of most interest are those that are largest in magnitude (or most consistently present) at the highest dose of drug. Regions identified as having significantly altered rCBF with drug are then examined in images from lower doses. 
 In this study we used a two-level, mixed effects approach to analysis, with the goal of identifying only effects likely to be representative of the entire population from which our subjects were sampled ( Gläscher and Gitelman, 2008 ). First, for each subject in the study, changes in regional CBF (rCBF) were identified from the 60mg study arm using SPM8 software ( www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/ ) and a voxelwise general linear model that included factors representing study Drug (SYN115  vs.  placebo), Levodopa (before  vs.  during infusion), the Drug ×Levodopa interaction, and Task (i.e. behavioral state during the scan: 2-back working memory, 8 Hz reversing circular checkerboard, or visual fixation). A statistical parametric image for each subject was generated from the Drug contrast and a second one from the Drug × Levodopa contrast. 
 Statistical inference for the entire study was done across subjects in a second-level SPM analysis. The contrast images generated for each subject as described in the preceding paragraph were the input data for a voxelwise general linear model that included a covariate for subject Age (in years) and factors for subject Sex (male, female) and Dose of SYN115 in the active capsules (20mg or 60mg). Statistical inference was performed at each voxel with a one-sample  t  test (i.e., testing across subjects whether the Drug contrast subject images are significantly less than or greater than zero). 
 Multiple comparisons correction was performed at the cluster level with the false discovery rate (FDR) set at p = 0.05, according to our prespecified analysis strategy. However, to minimize Type II error, we also list in  Supplementary Table 3  all peaks with uncorrected p<0.001. Highlighted entries in this table indicate peaks that would be considered significant by a different statistical criterion, such as single-voxel (magnitude-based) False Discovery Rate correction. In this data set the Bonferroni correction would accept as significant all voxels with t > 4.8. 
 Approximate anatomical locations were provided by the Talairach Daemon client ( www.talairach.org ) ( Lancaster et al., 2000 ), with corrections by reference to the study-specific MRI template atlas image. 
 
 
 Image sampling and VOI definition 
 Local maxima (“peaks”) from significant clusters were selected for further analysis. Mean rCBF values representing each peak were derived from a 12mm-diameter spherical VOI centered at the peak. This diameter corresponds to the 10–12mm resolution (FWHM) of the data as estimated by SPM. These VOIs were masked to include only voxels with  t  value exceeding the value corresponding to  p  < 0.001 uncorrected, and only voxels represented in the final mask ( Supplementary Figure 7 ). 
 
 
 Pharmacodynamic parameter estimation 
 We estimated the classic pharmacodynamic parameters  E max  (maximal effect) and EC 50  (drug concentration in plasma that produces an effect equal to 50% · E max ) using custom software by Dr. G. Larry Bretthorst that implements a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation method ( Bretthorst, 1988 ). The equation is  E ( C ) =  E (0) +  E max  ·  C n  /  (EC 50 n  +  C n ), where  n  is the Hill coefficient (unitless) that controls the steepness of the sigmoid curve. The independent variable  C  is the plasma concentration in ng/ml of SYN115 sampled in the pre-levodopa or on-levodopa state in which the corresponding ASL images were obtained. The dependent variable  E , effect of drug, was each subject’s fractional change in mean rCBF in the VOI centered at the SPM peak, relative to the pre-levodopa value from that subject’s placebo day ( Eli Lilly and Company and NIH Chemical Genomics Center, 2008 ). Data from the 20mg and 60mg arms were considered together. Prior probabilities are given in  Supplementary Table 4 . The appropriateness of the pharmacodynamic model to these data was quantified by the probability that it better explained the data than a polynomial with the same number of free parameters. 
 
 
 
 Results 
 Every subject who took any dose of study drug or placebo completed every scheduled MRI scan at every assessment session, except for one subject who was discharged from the 20mg arm of the study on the morning of the first assessment day due to noncompliance. This subject had already participated without error in the 60mg arm but is not counted in the 12 subjects who completed the 20mg arm. Thus for all included subjects, all scheduled CBF scans were included in the analyses, for a total of 832 CBF scans (derived from 52,416 echo-planar image volumes). 
 Subjects were on average 60.8 years old (range 44–73), had a 5.3-year mean duration of PD symptoms (range 0.9–10.8), and 12 of the 21 had ever experienced dopa-induced dyskinesias. All were Caucasian and right-handed, and 8 of the 21 were women. Compliance was excellent as assessed by pill counts. The levodopa infusion produced plasma concentrations of 816 ± 168 ng/ml (mean ± SD) and plasma concentrations did not differ significantly between conditions (t test, p>0.20). 
 
 Whole-brain blood flow effects 
 SYN115 induced a small dose-dependent decrease in mean global CBF (20mg p.o. BID, mean 4%, p<0.001 by paired  t  test; 60mg p.o. BID, 7%, p<0.001). As noted in Methods, this change in gCBF with drug was removed from the images before proceeding to the analyses described below. 
 
 
 Decreases in rCBF with SYN115 
 SYN115 induced highly significant decreases in regional CBF. Eight clusters met the predefined criteria for statistical significance after correction for multiple comparisons ( Table 1 ). The first cluster ( corrected  p<10 −31 ), had its peak t value in thalamus but also extended into midbrain, precuneus, cuneus, and cerebellum ( Figure 2 a,d ). Volumes of interest (VOIs) from 7 t-value local maxima (“peaks”) from this cluster were selected for further analysis (left and right thalamus, left and right midbrain, precuneus [BA 7, BA 31], and posterior cingulate [BA 30]), as described in Methods; atlas coordinates for the center of each VOI are given in  Supplementary Table 3 .  Figure 2 c  highlights the peak voxel from Cluster 2. For completeness,  Supplementary Table 3  lists every local maximum in the thresholded | t | image that was separated from other maxima by ≥ 8mm). To check the specificity of our results, we repeated the analysis using only those CBF scans acquired off levodopa during the visual fixation condition; results were similar ( Supplementary Figure 8 ). 
 As mentioned, the most statistically significant decreases in blood flow with 60mg b.i.d. SYN115 occurred in bilateral thalamus ( Figure 2 a ). The rCBF changes at these regions were dose-responsive ( Figure 2 b ). The decreases in the right thalamus VOI were even larger in the original images, prior to removing the whole-brain (mean global) CBF decrease: 20mg, −10.4%; 60mg, −19.0%. 
 
 
 Dose-responsiveness of rCBF decreases 
 The regions with decreased rCBF were identified using only the images acquired in subjects who took the higher dose of SYN115. Nevertheless, across the 20 VOIs listed in  Table 2 , the rCBF decreases were consistently greater in magnitude at the higher dose than at the lower dose (before levodopa: 18 of 20 VOIs; after levodopa: 20 of 20 VOIs). We carried out secondary SPM analyses to test whether this dose-responsive pattern was an artifact of selecting the VOIs from the higher-dose group only, and concluded that it was not (results from an analysis of the 5 subjects who had data from both doses of active drug are given in  Supplementary Table 5  and results from a similar analysis across both dose groups are in  Supplementary Table 6 ). 
 
 
 Quantifying SYN115 potency 
 The placebo–20mg–60mg dose-response plot does not allow estimation of EC 50 . We exploited the inherent pharmacokinetic variability across subjects to create a group concentration-response curve ( Figure 3 ) for the rCBF change in each of the VOIs identified in  Supplementary Table 3  and  Table 2 . We summarize here the results from thalamus and midbrain VOIs. In each case the pharmacodynamic model was the more appropriate model (probability 92%–100%;  Table 2 ). In the before-levodopa state, the estimated maximum possible SYN115 effect on rCBF ( E max ) was a 29%–30% decrease in thalamus and a 15%–32% decrease in midbrain. Left midbrain (near superior colliculus, EC 50  = 202 ng/ml) was more sensitive than thalamus (EC 50  = 942–966 ng/ml) and right midbrain (near SNr and pons, 1044 ng/ml). The Hill coefficient  n  was about 1 for these VOIs, indicating a gradual increase in signal magnitude as blood concentration rises (open double-line curves in  Figure 3 ). The model ascribed a small effect on blood flow in these regions to levodopa itself (indicated by the nonzero  E (0) entries in  Table 2 ). In scans acquired during the levodopa infusion, the rCBF response to SYN115 changed more sharply over a narrower range of SYN115 concentrations ( n  = 4.03–7.10; solid curves in  Figure 3 ) and thus the concentrations actually observed in our study came closer to producing the maximal predicted rCBF response ( E max ). 
 
 
 Increases in rCBF with SYN115, and levodopa effects 
 No statistically significant clusters were found for relative increases in rCBF with SYN115 or for the Drug × Levodopa interaction. The study was not designed to examine changes in rCBF with levodopa, and an SPM analysis found no significant decreases, but rCBF increased significantly with levodopa in one small cluster with peak values in the right putamen, claustrum and insula (see also  Supplementary Table 8 ). 
 
 
 
 Discussion 
 The A 2a  antagonist SYN115 substantially decreased CBF in mediodorsal thalamus, midbrain, precuneus and cingulate cortex. Since direct vascular effects would apply to all regions of the brain, the most likely explanation for the regionally specific CBF effects is that SYN115 crosses the blood-brain barrier and alters neuronal firing. The dose-responsive nature of the rCBF effects strongly suggests that they reflect pharmacological effects of SYN115 in the brain. 
 
 Perfusion MRI in pharmaceutical development 
 The results answer the primary questions posed in the introduction: SYN115 causes pharmacodynamic effects in the brain, and they are greater at the higher dose. The quantitative EC 50  estimates ( Figure 3  and  Table 2 ) suggest that an even higher dose may be more effective in terms of thalamic CBF response and perhaps also clinically. Confirmation of that hypothesis will require a large clinical study, but in this study a measure of motor speed improved significantly only on the higher dose of SYN115 (K. J. Black et al., unpublished observations). 
 Kofke et al. (2007) reported CBF effects of remifentanil, an FDA-approved opioid agonist, at 3 doses in 6 human brain regions chosen  a priori , and similar results were reported in other species (see Introduction). However, to our best knowledge, no prior pharmacological challenge neuroimaging study has calculated quantitative EC 50 ’s. 
 
 
 Physiological interpretation 
 An important question is which neurons are responsible for these rCBF changes. Numerous studies provide evidence that the metabolic response to stimulation of a neuron occurs primarily at the axon termini ( Buzsáki et al., 2007 ), including an FDG PET study in PD patients whose GPi electrical activity was measured invasively ( Eidelberg et al., 1997 ). Thus rCBF changes most likely reflect changes in the firing of afferent neurons. With this principle in mind,  Figure 4  shows how the known pharmacology and anatomy of the basal ganglia predict this study’s most significant result (see also  Supplementary Table 7 ). These results also accord with an 8–12% increase in thalamic glucose metabolism in untreated PD and the reduction of this increase by antiparkinsonian treatments ( Ma et al., 2009 ). 
 After thalamus, the brain regions most significantly affected by SYN115 were anterior cingulate (BA 32) and precuneus (BA 7, BA 23, and BA 31) ( Figure 2 c,d  and  Supplementary Table 3 ). The precuneus has several distinctive properties: in the fully awake alert state it consumes ~35% more glucose by weight than any other human cortical region ( Gusnard et al., 2001 ), and its metabolism and rCBF decrease markedly in various states of reduced or absent consciousness (e.g., slow-wave sleep, propofol-induced anesthesia, and vegetative states) ( Cavanna and Trimble, 2006 ). This may be relevant since SYN115 at 60mg p.o. b.i.d. decreased self-reported sleepiness (M. C. Campbell et al., unpublished observations). The precuneus and anterior cingulate are also key components of the default-mode network, a network of brain regions with high tonic activity at rest that is significantly attenuated during goal-directed tasks ( Raichle et al., 2001 ). Dopamine D2 and D3 agonists reduced rCBF in these regions ( Figure 5 ), and a recent report suggested a dopaminergic link between attention and precuneus deactivation ( Tomasi et al., 2010 ). In fact, an fMRI study reported anomalous precuneus and adjacent posterior cingulate responses in PD patients, compared to control subjects, during performance of an executive function task ( van Eimeren et al., 2009 ). 
 
 
 Comparison to caffeine effects 
 Most existing data on CBF effects of adenosine blockade come from studies of the nonspecific adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine. Caffeine has complex effects on cerebral metabolism and blood flow, so it is important to consider how, or whether, they inform interpretation of the results with a specific A 2a  antagonist. 
 Adenosine increases CBF ( Joshi et al., 2002 ), while caffeine decreases CBF by about 30% ( Cameron et al., 1990 ;  Perthen et al., 2008 ). This CBF decrease is fairly uniform throughout the brain ( Mathew et al., 1983 ;  Mathew and Wilson, 1985 ;  Gotoh et al., 2001 ;  Cameron et al., 1990 ) and unrelated to changes in respiration ( Cameron et al., 1990 ;  Mathew et al., 1983 ). This effect has been detected with ASL ( Laurienti et al., 2003 ;  Liu et al., 2004 ;  Bendlin et al., 2007 ;  Perthen et al., 2008 ). Metabolic studies show that direct vascular effects may produce this CBF decrease, since caffeine actually increased glucose utilization ( Nehlig et al., 1994 ;  Grome and Stefanovich, 1986 ;  Schroeder et al., 1989 ;  Gotoh et al., 2001 ).This uncoupling of CBF from metabolism led to a period of interest in the use of caffeine as a BOLD signal booster, though later work has been less enthusiastic. The uncoupling is likely mediated by adenosine receptors, since another nonspecific antagonist replicated the effect (theophylline;  Grome and Stefanovich, 1986 ). For these reasons cerebral metabolism may be more informative than CBF about the effects of caffeine on local neuronal activity. Regional effects of caffeine on cerebral glucose metabolism are strongest and most potent in dopamine-influenced brain regions such as habenula, caudate, ventral tegmental area, amygdala, and medial and lateral thalamus ( Nehlig et al., 1994 ;  Table 2  in  Nehlig and Boyet, 2000 ;  Figure 3  in  Gotoh et al., 2001 ). 
 However, caffeine’s effects probably differ substantially from those of specific A 2a  antagonists. The metabolic increases induced by caffeine appear to be mediated by A 1  receptors on neurons, whereas its global effects on blood flow are likely mediated by vascular A 2a  receptors ( Blood et al., 2003 ;  Kochanek et al., 2005 ). This mechanism is presumably responsible for the modest global decrease in CBF caused by SYN115. 
 
 
 Regional brain effects of specific A 2a  antagonists 
 Crucially, A 2a  receptors also occur on neurons, and selective A 2a  antagonists exert clinical, electrophysiological, and metabolic effects. Therefore, one also expects regionally specific CBF effects due to the neuronal actions of the drug, and these must be identified separately from the known direct vascular effects, which are global in nature. We contend that we have accomplished this for the first time in humans in the present study, but data from other species support our results. The A 2a  antagonist DMPX decreased glucose utilization in the rodent globus pallidus (GP) ( Nehlig et al., 1994 ), consistent with the finding that A 2a  antagonists reduce striatopallidal firing ( Strömberg et al., 2000 ). DMPX also decreased regional blood volume by 6–10% in thalamus, striatum and olfactory tubercle ( Chen et al., 2005 ). 
 The rCBF changes shown in  Figure 2  are comparable to those seen in 2DG and PET studies of dopamine agonists or levodopa (e.g.,  Figure 5 ). The regions of brain most sensitive to D2 and D3 receptor agonists included midbrain, posterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex, striatum, and thalamus ( Trugman et al., 1991 ;  Hershey et al., 1998 ;  2000 ;  Black et al., 2000 ;  2002b ;  2005 ). This correspondence may be expected given that A 2a  antagonists are thought to produce antiparkinsonian activity via facilitation of dopamine D2/D3 receptor effects. 
 
 
 Limitations 
 Crossover trial designs are susceptible to carryover effects. However, carryover effects are very unlikely in this study: on the placebo day, subjects either had received no prior SYN115 or had discontinued it >20 half-lives earlier. 
 Although the most significant result, decreased thalamic rCBF, is consistent with inhibition of the indirect pathway, that model does not predict all our results. No significant rCBF increase was detected in the STN, though partial volume effects may have hindered detection of CBF changes in this small nucleus ( Borghammer et al., 2009 ). Furthermore, the classical basal ganglia model does not predict the rCBF decrease observed in cortex. However, neither does it predict the similar cortical rCBF decrease observed with D2 and D3 dopamine agonists (e.g.,  Figure 5 e,f ). This observation lends credence to the idea that cortical rCBF responses are more complex than the indirect pathway model alone can predict. After all, most cortical areas receive input from cortical areas including homologous contralateral cortex and local recurrent axons and interneurons (see  Supplementary Table 7 ). One may even speculate that the cortical rCBF changes found in this study may prove to have predictive value in identifying medications with effects similar to those of dopamine D2 and D3 agonists. 
 Study participants self-selected for willingness to participate in research and met strict exclusion criteria. Nevertheless, they are clinically typical and had a range of levodopa dosing and comorbid conditions, so these results probably reflect early stage PD generally. The study also excluded patients taking dopamine agonists, but this exclusion strengthens confidence in our interpretation that SYN115 itself is responsible for the pallidothalamic inhibition seen here, rather than a possible interaction of SYN115 with a long-acting D2/D3 agonist. 
 Finally, we studied patients exposed to SYN115 for one week, and single doses or chronic dosing may show additional or different effects. These limitations should be balanced against the strengths of this work, including careful experimental design and a conservative statistical analysis. 
 
 
 Implications 
 These results suggest hypotheses about how adenosine A 2a  antagonists may exert antiparkinsonian or alerting effects, and identify brain regions to which electrophysiological methods may be directed to test these hypotheses. Additionally, these results demonstrate the potential for pharmacological challenge perfusion imaging to jump-start human dose selection in pharmaceutical development. This study provided dose-finding information quite rapidly in comparison with a typical clinical trial, and from relatively few subjects.

 Study design (see Methods: Study Protocol for important details). (a) Upper panel: schematic showing the temporal relationship of each subject’s scan days to his or her taking active study drug and placebo. (b) Lower panel: schematic showing each subject’s participation on each of his or her 2 scan days. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 2 
 
 (a) Statistical image (color) representing the | t | values from the contrast (rCBF on SYN115 60mg bid) < (rCBF on placebo), laid over the study-specific MRI template image (grayscale). The right side of the brain is displayed on the right side of the coronal image and the bottom of the axial image. The color  t  image shows all voxels for which | t | ≥ 4.03 (corresponding to  p  < 0.001 uncorrected). The orthogonal hairlines in each cross section identify the location of the other two cross sections, and cross at the voxel in right thalamus with the highest | t | in the whole image (19.51, 11 d.f.). 
 (b) Dose-dependent decrease in rCBF with SYN115 in the right and left thalamus VOIs defined as described in Methods. (c) and (d) The same image and conventions described in (a), with different cross sections chosen to display other peak | t | values. (c) Hairlines cross at the peak | t | value from Cluster 2. (d) Hairlines cross at the local peak that defined VOI 3 from Cluster 1 (in precuneus). See  Table 1  and  Supplementary Table 3  for coordinates and anatomical descriptions. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 3 
 
 The pharmacokinetic variability across subjects was exploited to create a population dose-response curve for the rCBF change in the right dorsomedial thalamus VOI. See “Results: Quantifying SYN115 potency for decreasing rCBF as a function of plasma concentration” for further details.

 Regional CBF responses to levodopa and to specific dopamine receptor agonists, from prior studies. Note the midbrain response in all studies and the thalamus and posterior cingulate response in the D2 and D3 agonist studies. (a) levodopa/carbidopa, PD and healthy controls ( Hershey et al., 1998 ), (b) levodopa/carbidopa, advanced PD ( Black et al., 2005 ), (c) levodopa/carbidopa, baboon ( Hershey et al., 2000 ), (d) dopamine D 1  agonist SKF82958, baboon ( Black et al., 2000 ), (e) dopamine D 2  agonist U91356a, baboon ( Black et al., 2002a ), (f) dopamine D 3 >D 2  agonist pramipexole, baboon ( Black et al., 2002b ). Figures (c) and (d) are from additional, unpublished analyses of the data collected for the publications named above.
