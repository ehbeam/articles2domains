 Early-life stress (ES) has been associated with diverse forms of psychopathology. Some investigators suggest that these associations reflect the effects of stress on the neural circuits that support cognitive control. However, very few prior studies have examined the associations between ES, cognitive control, and underlying neural architecture. The present study compares adolescents with a documented history of ES to typical adolescents on a cognitive control task using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twelve ES adolescents who were adopted because of early caregiver deprivation (9 females, age = 13 years ± 2.58) and 21 healthy control adolescents without a history of ES (10 females, age = 13 years ± 1.96) who resided with their biological parents performed the  change  task ( Nelson et al., 2007 ) - a variant of the stop task -during fMRI. Behaviourally, ES adolescents took longer to switch from a prepotent response (“ go ”) to an alternative response (“ change ”) than control adolescents. During correct “ change ” responses vs. correct “ go ” responses, this behavioural group difference was accompanied by higher activation in ES subjects than controls. These differences were noted in regions involved in primary sensorimotor processes (pre- and postcentral gyri), conflict monitoring (dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus), inhibitory and response control (inferior prefrontal cortex and striatum), and somatic representations (posterior insula). Furthermore, correct “ change ” responses vs. incorrect “ change ” responses recruited the inferior prefrontal cortex (BA 44/46) more strongly in ES subjects than controls. These data suggest impaired cognitive control in youth who experienced ES.

 Introduction 
 Early-life stress (ES) influences brain development and confers risk for later psychopathology, including anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance abuse, and psychosis ( Bremner et al., 1993 ;  Carrion, Weems et al., 2009 ;  Fisher et al., 2009 ;  Kilpatrick et al., 2003 ;  Ritchie et al., 2009 ;  Schenkel et al., 2005 ;  Stein et al., 1996 ). These psychopathological consequences might be mediated by the disruption of cognitive processes and their associated neural underpinnings ( Bremner & Vermetten, 2001 ). In humans, the impact of ES on cognitive functions such as memory, cognitive control, visuospatial processing, language, attention processing, and manual dexterity has been documented ( Chugani et al., 2001 ;  McEwen, 1998 ;  Nelson, Zeanah et al., 2007 ;  Pears & Fisher, 2005 ). Concomitantly, some initial studies found an association between ES and neural perturbations in affective ( Maheu et al., in press ), reward ( Dillon et al., 2009 ), memory ( Carrion, Haas et al., 2009 ), and executive ( Carrion et al., 2008 ) processing. 
 Notably, substantial improvement in cognitive control occurs across development ( Davidson et al., 2006 ;  Rubia et al., 2006 ), with mature skills finally emerging during early adulthood ( Bunge & Wright, 2007 ). These final cognitive refinements are accompanied by changes in neural activation, particularly in structures implicated in executive control ( Bunge et al., 2002 ;  Luna et al., 2001 ) and goal-directed behavior ( Ernst & Mueller, 2008 ;  Ernst et al., 2006 ). Specifically, these structures include the inferior prefrontal cortex for inhibitory processes ( Aron et al., 2004 ), the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) for conflict detection/resolution ( Botvinick et al., 1999 ), and the striatal network involved in response coding and switching ( Atallah et al., 2007 ;  Casey et al., 2004 ;  Hikosaka & Isoda, 2010 ;  Loose et al., 2006 ). Developmental neuroimaging studies have shown that these same regions are recruited in adolescents during tasks that involve inhibition of a prepotent response ( Durston et al., 2006 ), conflict between two responses (e.g., stop-signal task) ( Leibenluft et al., 2007 ;  Pliszka et al., 2006 ), task switching ( Casey et al., 2004 ), or planning/execution of action ( Bunge & Wright, 2007 ). Unlike traditional studies of task switching that require a switch between abstract categories such as letters and numbers ( Mueller et al., 2007 ;  Rogers & Monsell, 1995 ), the current change task ( Nelson, Vinton et al., 2007 ) is similar to the antisaccade task, in which a prepotent response must be inhibited and replaced with an alternative one ( Hallett & Adams, 1980 ). Electrophysiological studies identified distinct inhibitory components when switching from prepotent to non-prepotent responses ( Mueller et al., 2009 ). Consequently, these types of tasks inherently require a strong motoric response. Not surprisingly, activations have also been reported in primary motor and sensorimotor cortices in adults ( Menon et al., 2001 ) and adolescents ( Schulz et al., 2004 ) completing go/no-go tasks. 
 Separation from the primary caregiver, as well as experiencing maltreatment or neglect, are all associated with severe physiological stress responses. Such experiences have been shown to alter neuroendocrine function ( McEwen, 1998 ;  Sanchez et al., 2010 ). For example, one study found that children in foster care exhibit disturbed daytime patterns of cortisol production ( Dozier, Manni et al., 2006 ). Moreover, work with monkeys has found that excessive exposure to cortisol can impair inhibitory control and prefrontal cortical function ( Lyons et al., 2000 ). Therefore, ES may have important influences on prefrontal cortical function via the neuroendocrine system. 
 Systems in flux, like the adolescent brain, are typically unstable and vulnerable to disruption. The current study addressed the hypothesis that adolescents with a history of ES would display perturbed performance on a cognitive-control task. We predicted that, relative to a group of healthy peers, ES adolescents would show deficits in cognitive control on the  change  task. Specifically, we hypothesized that reaction time [RT] on trials requiring a switch from a prepotent to a non-prepotent response would be slower in the ES group than the control group. With respect to neural correlates, we expected altered regional activation within the inferior prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and striatum in ES adolescents compared to controls ( Bunge et al., 2002 ;  Casey et al., 1997 ;  Durston et al., 2006 ,  Carrion et al., 2008 ). Consistent with the motoric requirements of this task ( Menon et al., 2001 ) and the differences in sensorimotor processing reported between controls and youth displaying psychopathology ( Schulz et al., 2004 ;  Suskauer et al., 2008 ), we also predicted functional alterations in primary motor and sensorimotor cortices. 
 
 
 Materials and Methods 
 
 Subjects 
 Twelve ES adolescents (13.16 years SD 2.58, 9 female) who resided with their adoptive parents and 21 non-ES adolescents (13.86 years SD 1.96, 10 female) who resided with their biological parents participated in the study. We chose to recruit ∼50% more controls than ES subjects in order to increase statistical power, reduce inter-subject variance, and obtain a truer representation of the mean for typical adolescents, given that individual developmental trajectories can differ greatly in adolescent samples. Groups did not differ on IQ, socioeconomic status (SES) ( Hollingshead, 1975 ), sex distribution, parental education, or State/Trait anxiety scores ( Spielberger et al., 1970 ) (all p>.05) ( Table 1 ). All subjects were carefully assessed by physical examination and structured psychiatric interviews (Kiddie-Schedule-for-Affective-Disorders–Present-and-Lifetime-version (KSADS) ( Kaufman et al., 1997 ). Parents (adoptive parents for the ES group, biological parents for the control group) were also interviewed about the adolescent participant's behaviours. The psychiatric interviews were conducted by experienced clinicians and achieved excellent inter-rater reliability (k>0.75). IQ was assessed using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence for Adolescents ( Wechsler, 1999 ). 
 Nine of the twelve ES participants had a history of neglect and maltreatment prior to their adoption. The other three ES participants had experienced unstable early environments as reflected by two to three foster placements before adoption. ES adolescents had resided in U.S. foster care or international orphanages for an average of 28.36 months (SD= 30.22) prior to their adoptive placement. All ES youths experienced their first placement between the ages of 1 and 74 months (MEAN = 16.25 months, SD 25.87 months); they had been placed in foster care between one and five times (MEAN 2.42, SD 1.16). ES adolescents were recruited as part of a larger, ongoing study and have been well-characterized in terms of their early-life experiences ( Dozier et al., 2008 ;  Dozier, Peloso et al., 2006 ). In the ES group, one adolescent suffered from enuresis, one from Oppositional Defiant Disorder, one from Generalised Anxiety Disorder, and two from Specific Phobia. None of these adolescents met criteria for a mood or anxiety disorder, including PTSD. Only one subject from the ES group was receiving medication (sertraline and methylphenidate). This subject discontinued methylphenidate for 30 hours prior to the fMRI study. With regards to prenatal risk in the ES group, one participant was born with a low birth weight and the mothers of four participants had suspected use of alcohol and/or drugs/cigarettes during pregnancy. 
 Adolescents from the control group were screened for an absence of medical or psychiatric problems, IQ greater than 70, and no history of maltreatment (as evaluated by the trauma section of the KSADS). The parents of participants provided written informed consent, and the adolescents provided written assent to participate in protocols approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and the University of Delaware. 
 
 
 Experimental paradigm 
 Cognitive control was probed using a variant of the stop-signal task, the  change  task ( McClure et al., 2005 ;  Nelson, Vinton et al., 2007 ). The  change  task measures the ability to inhibit a prepotent response ( go  response) and to switch to an alternative non-prepotent response ( change  response). To establish prepotency,  go  trials constituted 66% of the total experimental trials (excluding blank trials), and  change  trials 33%. Each trial began with a 500 ms fixation cross at the center of the screen. Fixation was then replaced with an “X” or an “O”, which was displayed for 1000 ms. Subjects were instructed to press button 1 when they saw an “X”, and button 2 when they saw an “O”. However, for 33% of the trials, a blue square appeared in the background after the appearance of the “X” or the “O”. On these trials, subjects were required to press button 3. Trials without the appearance of the blue square constituted the  go  trials, and those with the appearance of the blue square constituted the  change  trials. 
 On the first  change  trial, the  change  signal was displayed 250 ms after the  go  signal. Consistent with the Stop/Signal paradigm ( Logan et al., 1997 ), the delay between the onset of the  go  signal (“X” or “O”) and the onset of the  change  signal (blue square) varied from trial to trial and was adjusted to the subject's performance in order to ensure an approximately 50% correct response rate on change trials for all participants. If the previous  change  trial was performed correctly, the onset of the subsequent  change  signal was delayed by 50 ms, thereby making execution of a correct  change  response more difficult. If, on the other hand, the previous  change  trial was performed incorrectly, the onset of the  change  signal occurred 50 ms closer to the onset of the X/O signal, making execution of a correct  change  response easier. In addition, 88 blank fixation trials were randomly distributed across the task and served as the implicit fMRI baseline. The task was conducted over four 3.5-minute runs inside the scanner. Subjects were trained to proficiency prior to entering the scanner, i.e., mean reaction time of less than 1000 msec on  go  trials. Subjects also received feedback after each block, prompting them to speed up if the mean  go  reaction time exceeded 1000 msec. 
 
 
 FMRI data acquisition 
 All fMRI data were collected at the NIMH. Scanning took place in a General Electric 3 Tesla magnet scanner (Waukesha, WI, USA). Images were acquired with echoplanar single shot gradient echo T2* weighting. A total of 23 5-mm axial slices were acquired with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) 2000 ms; echo time (TE) 40; field of view (FOV) 240 mm; matrix 64 × 64. A single high-resolution structural image was also acquired for each subject to assist with spatial normalization. This image consisted of a spoiled gradient (SPGR) sequence: 180 1-mm axial slices; TR 11.4; TE 4.4; FOV 240 mm; number of acquisitions (NEX) 1; matrix 256 × 256; inversion time (TI) 300; bandwidth 130 Hz, pixel, 33 kHz/256 pixels. The paradigm was presented to the subjects inside the magnet via Avotec Silent Vision goggles (Stuart, FL, USA) mounted on the head coil directly above subjects' eyes. Each of the four runs consisted of 86 trials: 44  go  trials, 20  change  trials, and 22 blank fixation trials.  Go  trials,  change  trials, and fixation trials were distributed randomly across each run. In this event-related design, randomly interspersed fixation trials (2250 ms in duration each) allowed the experimental and statistical techniques to successfully deconvolve unique events occurring relatively close in time ( Friston et al., 1998 ;  Zarahn & Slifstein, 2001 ). In this statistical approach ( Zarahn et al., 1997 ), fixation trials were not modelled and provided an implicit baseline. 
 
 
 fMRI Analysis 
 Pre-processing steps of imaging data included slice timing correction, realignment, spatial normalization, and reslicing. To facilitate comparison with studies from our laboratory that used the same task in different populations ( Leibenluft et al., 2007 ;  Nelson, Vinton et al., 2007 ), we analysed the data with SPM99 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, UCL, London, UK) using the same parameters as in earlier studies. A statistical model was generated for each subject for correct  change  trials, incorrect  change  trials, correct  go  trials, and incorrect  go  trials. With regards to the number of trials used for modelling data, and in line with the group accuracy rates provided in  Table 1 , the statistical analyses included 160 (± 3)  go  trials and 88 (± 3) fixation trials on average for the ES group, and 156 (± 3)  go  trials and 88 (± 3) fixation trials on average for the control group. With regards to successful vs. unsucessful  change  trials, 40 (± 5) correct and 40 (± 5) incorrect  change  trials were used on average for the ES group, and 38 (± 4) correct and 42 (± 4) incorrect  change  trials on average for controls. The wave form used to model each event consisted of a rectangular pulse convolved with the hemodynamic response function provided by SPM99. A high-pass filter of 0.024Hz was applied to each subject's data prior to model estimation to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Contrast images were proportionally scaled to session baseline and smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel of 11.4-mm full width-half maximum (FWHM) ( Leibenluft et al., 2007 ). Individual subjects' contrasts were then entered into a second order (i.e., random effects) group level analysis. 
 All group level analyses employed  t -tests of the contrast values that each individual subject's data generated in the pre-determined event contrasts. The statistical threshold was set at p< 0.001 uncorrected for multiple comparisons with a spatial extent of at least 10 contiguous voxels ( Nelson, Vinton et al., 2007 ). Sex was used as a covariate of nuisance in all analyses because of a trend towards group differences in the distribution of this variable ( x 2 (1)=2.34, p=.13). 
 To examine the neural correlates involved in inhibiting a planned response and switching to an alternative response, we compared correct  change  responses to correct  go  responses. Moreover, to examine the neural correlates of brain responses during incorrect changes, we examined correct vs. incorrect  change  responses. To confirm that significant activations on the correct change vs. correct  go  contrast resulted from the  change  responses and not from mere responding to  go  trials, contrasts were decomposed into correct  change  trials vs. baseline and correct  go  trials vs. baseline ( Figure 1B ). Similarly, to tease out whether the activity in the correct vs. incorrect  change  trials stemmed from either correct or incorrect responding, each component was compared against baseline ( Figure 2B ). All activations are in MNI coordinates (mm). 
 Finally, to control for a potential confounding effect of group differences in response time in the [correct  change  vs correct  go ] contrast, a multivariate ANCOVA was conducted on extracted individual peak voxel values with Group as the between-subjects factor and individual  change  signal reaction time (CSRT) as the covariate of nuisance. Statistical threshold was set at p<.05, corrected using the step-down Bonferroni-Holm procedure. 
 
 
 Behavioural analysis 
 Behavioural data were analysed using Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA). In addition to  go  and  change  accuracy, we examined the mean inhibit delay (MID) and the CSRT. The MID is an index of task difficulty and is calculated by subtracting the mean onset time of the  change  signal from the mean onset time of the go signal. The CSRT is an estimation of the speed of the subject's  change  response. When a subject changed successfully on 50% of  change  trials, the CSRT was the mean  go  reaction time minus the MID ( Logan et al., 1997 ). Because a subject's accuracy could deviate from 50%, an interpolation algorithm was used to calculate CSRT, such that CSRT =  go  reaction time at the Xth percentile minus mean MID, where X is the subject's percent accuracy on  change  trials ( Nelson, Vinton et al., 2007 ). As with the fMRI data, sex was used as a covariate in all behavioural analyses. 
 
 
 
 Results 
 
 Behavioural performance ( Table 1 ) 
 ES youths switched to an alternative response on  change  trials (CSRT: 289.03 ms ± 17.84) significantly more slowly than controls (CSRT: 231.09 ms ± 13.35) (F(1,30)=6.54, p=.02). Accuracy for  go  trials did not differ significantly between the ES (91.282% ± 2.53%) and control groups (89.20% ± 1.89%) (F(1,30)=0.42, p=.52). Similarly, the mean RT of  go  trials (ES group: 920 ms ± 39 ms; controls: 914 ms ± 29 ms) and the MID time (ES: 434 ms ± 40 ms; control: 490 ms ± 30 ms) did not differ between groups (F(1,30)=0.16, p=.89 and F(1,30)=.1.22, p=.28, respectively). Finally, because the paradigm was designed to keep error rates around 50%, ES and control groups did not differ on errors on  change  trials (49.95% vs. 46.88%) (F,1,30)=0.42, p=.52) ( Table 1 ). With respect to sex, the error rate for  change  trials was lower for males (41%) than females (53%) (F(1,30)=8.26, p<.05). CSRT did not correlate with state (r 2 (29)=.16, p=.38) or trait (r 2 (27)=-0.5, p=.83) measures of anxiety. 
 
 
 FMRI 
 
 Correct change trials vs. correct go trials 
 The SPM analysis of correct  change  (vs. correct  go ) trials revealed significantly higher activation (all at p≤.001, uncorrected) for the ES group relative to controls in a set of regions involved in motor and cognitive control (see  Table 2 ). Specifically, these regions included: the left inferior prefrontal cortex (BA44, xyz = -50 18 8), typically involved in response inhibition and task switching; the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC, BA24, xyz = 22 6 40) and left anterior cingulate cortex (BA32, xyz =-20 18 32), both involved in conflict monitoring; striatal structures (left putamen, xyz = -20 18 6 and left caudate, xyz =-8 10 16), involved in response planning and execution; and the primary motor (BA4, xyz = 46 -8 42) and sensorimotor cortices (BA3, xyz = 22 -28 46) underlying the motor and sensorimotor aspects of the task. In addition to expected changes seen in these regions, a group difference emerged in the posterior left claustrum/insula (BA13, xyz = -30 -22 10) ( Table 2 ), also reflecting enhanced activation in the ES group relative to controls ( Figure 1A ). No regional activations were found to be greater in the controls than in the ES group. 
 To examine whether the significantly increased activations for the ES group reflected the switch process ( change  trials) or were a mere result of motor response ( go  trials), the contrasts were further separated into  change  trials vs. fixation, and  go  trials vs. fixation. The results revealed that the contributions to the significant activation stemmed from the  change  trials (all F(1,29)> 6.00, p<.02, except for the cingulate activation BA32 which approached significance (F(1,29)=3.93, p=.057)), and not from the  go  trials (all F(1,29)<1.26, all p>.21) ( Figure 1B ). 
 
 
 Correct change vs. incorrect change trials 
 In contrast to correct  change  trials vs. incorrect  change  trials, the ES group showed significantly greater activation in three regions (all at p<.001, uncorrected) compared to controls: the left inferior prefrontal gyrus (BA46, xyz = -40 34 6), the left precentral/inferior frontal gyrus (BA44, xyz = -58 4 8), and the left claustrum/insula (xyz = -26 26 -2) ( Table 2 / Figure 2A ). Further analysis of this contrast revealed that the significant trial by group interaction was primarily related to group differences in correct  change  trials (all F(1,29)>5.50, all p<.03), and not incorrect  change  trials (all F(1,29)<0.82, ns). However, the deactivation of the inferior frontal gyrus seen in the ES group during these incorrect trials may also have contributed to the interaction ( Figure 2B ). 
 
 
 
 Additional analyses 
 A multivariate ANCOVA controlling for individual CSRT (covariate of nuisance) in the go vs. change contrast revealed that group differences in activations in the ACC (BA24), postcentral gyrus and IFG remained significant (at p<.05, corrected), while the other areas were trending (p<.10, corrected). These results suggest that the observed group differences were not accounted for by group differences in motoric speed. 
 
 
 
 Discussion 
 The present study addressed the extent to which ES is associated with perturbations in cognitive control, which, in turn, could confer risk for psychopathology in this population. Our findings support this hypothesis at both the behavioural and neural level. In this study, and consistent with previous reports of perturbations on cognitive control tasks in adopted youth ( Lewis et al., 2007 ), the ES group showed prolonged reaction times compared to controls when inhibiting a prepotent response and executing an alternative one. Furthermore, group differences in neural activity showed greater activation in the ES group than in controls in several regions involved in cognitive control. These included the inferior frontal cortex (BA junction 44/45 and 46), a region previously identified as playing a critical role in cognitive inhibitory control ( Aron et al., 2004 ;  Bunge et al., 2002 ;  Durston et al., 2006 ;  Leung & Cai, 2007 ), and the striatum, a region involved in response control ( Atallah et al., 2007 ;  Casey et al., 2004 ;  Loose et al., 2006 ). The current study found these regions to be more active in the ES group than in controls during correct  change  trials relative to  go  trials (BA44/45, striatum) as well as during correct vs. incorrect  change  responses (BA44/46). Comparisons against fixation confirmed that the greater activation seen in the ES group vs. controls occurred during the  change  trials and not during the  go  trials, suggesting an impaired behavioural control aspect of the task rather than impaired simple motor response. In addition, IFG, dACC and postcentral gyrus findings remained robust, while the remaining regions were trending, when controlling for CSRT, suggesting that differences in neural activation were not due to the slower execution of the alternative response in the ES group. 
 Studies in psychiatric samples indicate that psychopathology may disrupt the same prefrontal-striatal circuitry whose function differed between our ES sample and controls ( Carrion et al., 2008 ;  Durston et al., 2006 ;  Leibenluft et al., 2007 ;  Nelson, Vinton et al., 2007 ;  Schulz et al., 2004 ). Indeed, the neural pattern of our data is consistent with neuroimaging findings of disorders for which ES populations show enhanced risk. Findings in adults, for instance, have associated depression with distinct patterns of activation in the inferior frontal and anterior cingulate regions during inhibitory control tasks ( Langenecker et al., 2007 ). Likewise, fronto-striatal and somatosensory network alterations during cognitive inhibition have been reported in individuals with PTSD ( Falconer et al., 2008 ). In youths, prior studies of ES have focused primarily on morphological differences ( De Bellis & Kuchibhatla, 2006 ;  Eluvathingal et al., 2006 ;  Mehta et al., 2009 ;  Teicher et al., 2004 ); nevertheless, preliminary investigations using functional imaging have yielded interesting patterns.  Maheu and colleagues (in press)  reported medial temporal lobe dysfunction during emotional face processing in ES subjects, some of whom were included in the current sample. In another sample of maltreated youth, Dillon and colleagues ( Dillon et al., 2009 ) found decreased responding of the basal ganglia to reward stimuli. The current findings extend prior reports to a clinical non-PTSD sample. 
 Notably, current IFG activations were left-lateralized. Studies in adults commonly associate the right IFG with inhibitory processes (e.g.,  Aron et al., 2004 ). Three possible explanations can account for this discrepancy. First, a recent meta-analysis of inhibitory control studies that included a set of patients with selective left inferior frontal gyrus lesions reported a critical involvement of this region in inhibitory control ( Swick et al., 2008 ), suggesting a bilateral contribution of the IFG to inhibitory control. Second, activation in the left IFG could also account for the shift process (pressing button 3 during the  change  signal instead of buttons 1 or 2), in addition to the inhibitory process. Indeed,  Loose and colleagues (2006)  reported left-sided IFG activations during a response switching task. Finally, significantly activated clusters in left IFG have also been reported in children during successful resolution of response ambiguity ( Bunge et al., 2002 ). More research in pediatric populations is needed to disentangle the contribution of each of these processes to the current findings. 
 Similar to the group differences in inferior frontal gyrus and striatum activation, the ES group showed heightened activations in motor and sensorimotor cortices than controls. Prior studies in youths with ADHD ( Schulz et al., 2004 ) and healthy volunteers ( Menon et al., 2001 ) have also documented activations in BAs 3/4 in go/no-go studies. Given that fine motor skills of the fingers are required to flexibly select and press the correct out of 3 possible buttons on the current task, our findings are further consistent with a report of impaired manual dexterity in neglected youth ( Chugani et al., 2001 ). However, the absence of group differences in reaction times to  go  stimuli in the present study complicate interpretation. Regardless, heightened activation of these regions could reflect developmental disruptions of primary sensorimotor areas in ES. 
 Likewise, the anterior cingulate cortex has also been implicated in response conflict but not in stimulus conflict during task switching ( Liston et al., 2006 ;  Rushworth et al., 2002 ). In this study, increased activation was present in two regions of the dACC (BA24 and BA32). Prior functional studies of youths with cognitive control deficits ( Pliszka et al., 2006 ;  Rubia et al., 1999 ;  Tamm et al., 2004 ) and PTSD after maltreatment ( Carrion et al., 2008 ) documented changes in dACC function during inhibitory control tasks. In particular, in a similar study in youths with post-traumatic stress symptoms that used a block design to compare go and no-go trials,  Carrion et al. (2008)  reported hyperactivations in both BAs 24 and 32. Likewise, previous morphological studies documented smaller grey matter volumes in the dACC of adults who experienced adverse life events in childhood ( Cohen et al., 2006 ) or adulthood ( Ganzel et al., 2008 ). Consequently, our findings are in-line with prior data linking this region with cognitive control and adverse experiences; they also extend previous research and suggest that ES might perturb a network involved in motor control aspects of executive tasks leading to a difficulty in resolving response conflict. 
 Finally, an interesting but unexpected finding was the hyperactivation of the posterior insula/claustrum observed in the ES group. Although the posterior insula is commonly associated with pain and visceral sensory functions ( Augustine, 1996 ), other studies have documented a role in working memory ( Paulesu et al., 1993 ) and divided attention ( Corbetta et al., 1991 ). The current task required divided attention given that participants had to distinguish between letters as well as pay attention to a sudden change in background colour when a switch in responses was required. Moreover, previous studies have reported perturbed attentional emotional processing in maltreated youth ( Pine et al., 2005 ), supporting the idea of impaired attention processing following ES. Taken together, the present study demonstrates the impact of ES on several brain regions including fronto-striatal circuitry, dACC, and insula/claustrum during cognitive control. However, the small sample precludes us from examining the contribution of the specific types of stress experienced. Future studies using animal models could further explore the vulnerability of particular brain regions to specific stressors. 
 One strength of this sample is that participants were recruited from a very well-characterized and longitudinally followed cohort ( Dozier et al., 2008 ;  Dozier, Peloso et al., 2006 ). However, a few limitations of the study also need to be addressed. One concern is the heterogeneity of the relatively small sample. A common problem in conducting studies in ES youth is recruitment; indeed, previous studies have suffered from similar limitations in their ability to report differences in the type of maltreatment experienced in their sample ( Carrion et al., 2008 ;  Dillon et al., 2009 ) or in samples coming from different orphanages ( Evulathingal et al., 2006 ;  Chugani et al., 2001 ). Another problem is the extent to which prenatal factors, such as malnutrition or prenatal exposure to drugs, may have contributed to the present findings. This issue is very difficult to resolve because of poor historical information regarding drug use in the biological parents. The use of comparison groups of low birth-weight or those with known prenatal exposure to drugs might help to clarify these factors. It is important to note, however, that although youths may have experienced different types of stressors, one commonality is that all stressors are likely to trigger the same determinants of the stress response such as stress-related hormones (e.g., cortisol) and neurotransmitters (e.g., serotonin). A final issue concerns the fact that four adopted participants suffered from a psychiatric disorder. However, when these four subjects were removed from the analysis (data not shown), the pattern of results was unchanged, suggesting that psychiatric morbidity had little impact on the present data. 
 In summary, the present study extends previous behavioural evidence and demonstrates perturbations in the neural circuits critical for cognitive and motor control in youths with ES. ES, here, included early separation from the biological parent, several separations from caregivers before adoption, and early neglect and abuse. Future studies should replicate and refine these findings. In particular, critical periods of development, the type of maltreatment experienced, and other prenatal factors such as exposure to drugs will need to be investigated.

 Demographic information : Demographic information for ES and control groups including mean age, IQ, social economic status, use of medication, and any co-morbid disorders. * Unfortunately, due to some missing scores, the comparison of BMI in the healthy volunteers is based on a subset of 14 controls and the STAI state/trait comparison on a subset of 17 controls for whom these data were available. The remaining data for these controls were missing.  Behavioural performance data  show the performance of subjects on the  change  task with regards to reaction time to  go  stimuli (ms), errors committed on these trials, mean reaction time to execute the change command (CSRT), and mean inhibit delay time (MID) of the change command.
