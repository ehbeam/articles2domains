 Multi-modal fusion is an effective approach to better understand brain diseases. However, most such instances have been limited to pair-wise fusion; because there are often more than two imaging modalities available per subject, there is a need for approaches that can combine multiple datasets optimally. In this paper, we extended our previous two-way fusion model called “multimodal CCA +joint ICA”, to three or  N  way fusion, that enables robust identification of correspondence among  N  data types and allows one to investigate the important question of whether certain disease risk factors are shared or distinct across multiple modalities. We compared “mCCA+jICA” with its alternatives in a 3-way fusion simulation and verified its advantages in both decomposition accuracy and modal linkage detection. We also applied it to real functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)-Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and structural MRI fusion to elucidate the abnormal architecture underlying schizophrenia (n=97) relative to healthy controls (n=116). Both modality-common and modality-unique abnormal regions were identified in schizophrenia. Specifically, the visual cortex in fMRI, the anterior thalamic radiation (ATR) and forceps minor in DTI, and the parietal lobule, cuneus and thalamus in sMRI were linked and discriminated between patients and controls. One fMRI component with regions of activity in motor cortex and superior temporal gyrus individually discriminated schizophrenia from controls. Finally, three components showed significant correlation with duration of illness (DOI), suggesting that lower gray matter volumes in parietal, frontal, temporal lobe and cerebellum are associated with increased DOI, along with white matter disruption in ATR and cortico-spinal tracts. Findings suggest that the identified fractional anisotropy changes may relate to the corresponding functional/structural changes in brain that are thought to play a role in the clinical expression of schizophrenia. The proposed “mCCA +jICA” method showed promise for elucidating the joint or coupled neuronal abnormalities underlying mental illnesses and improves our understanding of the disease process.

 INTRODUCTION 
 Multi-modal fusion (MMF) is an effective approach for analyzing biomedical imaging data that combines multiple data types in a joint analysis. MMF helps to identify the unique and shared variance associated with each imaging modality that underlies cognitive functioning in healthy controls and impairment in mental illness. The goal of multi-modal fusion is to capitalize on the strength of each imaging modality and their inter-relationships in a joint analysis, rather than to analyze each separately. 
 It is increasing clear that MMF may uncover the hidden relationships that can unify disparate findings in neuroimaging ( Calhoun, et al. 2006b ;  Correa, et al. 2010 ;  Plis, et al. 2011 ). For example, combining genetic and fMRI data together achieved better classification accuracy than using either type of data alone, indicating that genetic and brain function capture different, but partially complementary aspects of mental illness risk factors ( Yang, et al. 2010 ). Dysfunctional function-structure linkage has also been shown to delineate differences between patients with schizophrenia from healthy controls ( Michael, et al. 2010 ;  Rykhlevskaia, et al. 2008 ;  Skudlarski, et al. 2010 ). The findings in these and other studies suggest that MMF provides a more comprehensive description of altered brain connectivity than does analyses of a single modality. Currently most approaches focus on fusion of two modalities but there may be additional benefits to combine more than two modalities in one model and to allow examination of N-way cross-information. 
 We recently proposed a two-way fusion model, “multimodal CCA+ joint ICA” which has been successfully applied to discriminate schizophrenia and bipolar disorder by an fMRI-DTI fusion( Sui, et al. 2011 ). In the current paper, we improved the model to enable fusion of 3 or more multimodal datasets by utilizing multi-set CCA( Kettenring 1971 ) instead of classic pair-wise multimodal CCA. In addition, because N-way fusion of brain imaging data is more challenging than pair-wise fusion, we carefully evaluate the performance of the algorithm under various conditions. Our goal of N-way fusion also raises a number of important methodological issues. First, brain imaging data is high-dimensional data that is generally limited to a small number of subjects. While the small sample sizes may not generate enough statistical power, one major means to improve the fusion results is to analyze data from more subjects, perhaps via multisite analyses. For example, in ( Sui, et al. 2011 ), at least 48 SZ and 37 BP are needed to detect differences from healthy controls at a power of 0.8. More generally, when the effect size is 0.5, at least 64 subjects are needed per group ( N =2) to reach a statistical power of 0.8 in detecting group differences ( Erdfelder, et al. 1996 ). In addition, the high-dimensional neuroimaging data is typically very noisy and huge redundancy reduction is usually necessary. Furthermore, many fusion applications rely on studying correlations between highly distilled measures ( e.g.  small regions of interest), but there is still relatively little examination of the full relationships among data types. The method and tools we propose will enable examination of full correspondence of whole brain data and can be potentially useful for identification of unique biomarkers of brain disorders. 
 Existing multivariate fusion methods have different optimization priorities and limitations: Some enable common as well as distinct levels of connection among modalities, such as multi-set canonical correlation analysis (mCCA) ( Correa, et al. 2009 ) and partial least squares (PLS) ( Chen, et al. 2009 ;  Lin, et al. 2003 ), but their separated sources may not be sufficiently spatially sparse. For example, mCCA maximizes the inter-subject covariation across two sets of features and generates two linked variables, one from each dataset, i.e., canonical variants (CVs); which correlate with each other only on the same indices (rows) and their corresponding correlation values are called canonical correlation coefficients (CCC). This scheme allows for both common and distinct aspects of two features, but the brain maps of several components may look similar when the CCC are not sufficiently distinct. Some approaches perform well in spatial decomposition, such as joint ICA (jICA) ( Calhoun, et al. 2006a ) and linked ICA ( Groves, et al. 2011 ), which aim to maximize the independence among estimated sources combining more than two modalities, but only allow a common mixing matrix. These two methods enable detection of features common to all modalities at the expense of features which may be distinct to one or more of them (a situation which becomes more likely when combining more than two modalities). Multiple previous studies that combined function and structure ( Camara, et al. 2010 ;  Olesen, et al. 2003 ;  Rykhlevskaia, et al. 2008 ;  Sui, et al. 2012 ) provide support for the assumption that components decomposed from each modality have some degree of correlation between their mixing profiles among subjects. This motivates our data-driven model that is optimized for both flexibility in inter-modal associations and high capability on source separation. 
 The basic strategy of mCCA+jICA is shown in  Figure 1 . Multi-set CCA is first adopted to project the data in a space so that the correlations among mixing profiles ( D k , k=1,2,3) of three or more modalities are jointly maximized (in their sum of squared correlations). The resulted canonical variates (CVs)  D k  are sorted by correlation which provides a closer initial match and makes the further application of joint ICA more reliable. At this time, the associated maps ( C k ,  k =1,2,3,  X k  =  D k · C k ) may not be completely separated by mCCA. We then apply joint ICA on the concatenated maps [ C 1, C 2,  C 3 ] to obtain the final independent source  S k . In other words, mCCA first relates multiple datasets with flexible linkages (correlation) in their mixing matrices, thus giving us more confidence to perform jICA on the joint spatial maps. This results in both highly and weakly correlated joint independent components. Hence, mCCA and jICA are complementary to one another and if used together can relax the limitations of each. 
 In order to reduce the redundancy of the large scale brain data and facilitate the identification of relationships between modalities, each modality is first reduced to a “feature” for each subject,  e.g.  an fMRI contrast map from the general linear model, a gray matter (GM) segmentation image from the sMRI scan and voxel-wise DTI measures such as fractional anisotropy (FA). For task-related fMRI data, the contrast maps depict the cortical regions representing the task effect in relation to an experimental baseline, which already utilizes the temporal information. Such an approach does appear to be quite powerful and conveys similar information to a first-level analysis using original 4D fMRI data, as reported in ( Calhoun, et al. 2012 ). 
 To our knowledge there have been only a few reports combining three or more types of brain imaging data to investigate schizophrenia (SZ),  e.g.  ( Correa, et al. 2009 ) examined changes that are related across fMRI, sMRI and EEG data. Here we investigate not only modality-common but also modality-unique risk factors among three modalities in a comparison of patients with schizophrenia (n=97) versus healthy controls (n=116). The potential benefits of our approach are demonstrated both in a simulation and an application to multimodal group data. 
 
 
 METHOD AND MATERIALS 
 
 Theory Development 
 We assume that the multimodal dataset  X k , is a linear mixture of  M k  sources given by  S k , mixed with a non-singular mixing matrix  A k  for each,  k  denotes modality.
 (1) X k = A k S k k = 1 , 2 , … n 
where  X k  is a subjects-by-voxels feature matrix (we use voxels for our description but this could also be,  e.g. , time points or genes). The sources  S k , are distinct within each dataset, while the columns of  A i  and  A j  have higher correlation only on their corresponding indices,  i ,  j  ∊{1,2… n }  i  ≠  j  are modality number. Given that there are  N  subjects, typically, the number of voxels  L  in  X k  is much larger than  N . Due to the high dimensionality and high noise levels in the brain imaging data, order selection is critical to avoid over-fitting the data. Using a modified minimum description length (MDL) criterion described in ( Li, et al. 2007 ), the number of independent components is estimated for each modality by a sub-sampling scheme to obtain a set of effectively independently identical distributed (i.i.d.) samples from the dependent data samples, followed by applying information-theoretic criteria (ITC) formulas to the effectively i.i.d. sample set. We set the final component number for joint ICA as  M  = max( M 1 ,  M 2 … M n ), which maximally retains the joint information while also ensuring that the decomposed sources are independent from each other. Note that the whole analysis including mCCA is based on the independent order selection, please see more details in the  appendix  on simulation of blind source separation (BSS) performance testing using different number of  M , in which mCCA+jICA performs better when  M  =max( M 1 ,  M 2 … M n ) and among 3 methods. 
 Dimension reduction is then performed on  X k  using singular value decomposition to determine the signal subspace given by
 (2) Y k = X k E k k = 1 , 2 , … n 
where  Y k  is in size of  N×M  and  E k  contains eigenvectors corresponding to significant (the top  M  highest) singular values. 
 Multi-set CCA ( Kettenring 1971 ) is thus performed on  Y k , generating the canonical variates  D k  by maximizing the sum of squares of all correlation values in its corresponding columns as adopted in ( Li, et al. 2009 ). The canonical correlations can be obtained by optimizing a number of cost functions proposed in ( Kettenring 1971 ), e.g., maximizing the sum of squared correlations(SSQCOR) among the canonical variates. Consider the canonical variates  D k , where each is a linear combination of the dataset  Y k  given as
 (3) D k = Y k w k k = 1 , 2 , … n 
and  w k  are the canonical coefficient vectors. We can summarize the multi-set CCA procedure based on sum of squares cost as:
 (4) Stage 1 : { w 1 ( 1 ) , w 2 ( 1 ) , … , w n ( 1 ) } = arg max w { ∑ k , j = 1 n ∣ r k , j ( 1 ) ∣ 2 } 
 (5) for i = 2 : M Stage 2 : { w 1 ( i ) , w 2 ( i ) , … , w n ( i ) } = arg max w { ∑ k , j = 1 n ∣ r k , j ( i ) ∣ 2 } s . t . w k ( i ) ⊥ { w k ( 1 ) , w k ( 2 ) , … , w k ( i − 1 ) } , k = 1 , 2 , … , n end 
where  w k ( i ) ( i = 1 , … , M )  is the  i th  column of the  w  matrices,  r k , j ( i ) = corr ( D k ( i ) , D j ( i ) )  is the column-wise correlation,  k ≠ j ,  k,j =1,2,3 in our case.  M  ≤ min(rank( Y k )). 
 Stage 1 is solved by first calculating the partial derivative function of the SSQCOR cost with respect to each  w k ( 1 )  and equating it to zero to find the stationary point. Since the SSQCOR cost is a quadratic function of each  w k ( 1 ) , the partial derivative is a linear function of  w k ( 1 )  and hence, the closed form solution can be derived. Starting from an initial point, each  w k ( 1 )  vector is updated consequently guarantee an increase in the cost function and a sweep through all the  w k ( 1 )  constitutes one step of the iterative maximization procedure. The iterations are stopped when the cost convergence criterion is met and the resulting  w k ( 1 )  vectors are taken as the optimal solution. Stage 2 and higher stages are solved in a similar manner with the cost function replaced by a Lagrangian incorporating the orthogonality constraints on the canonical coefficient vectors. 
 Based on the above optimization, we simultaneously obtain  D k  from all modalities, which satisfy the following properties
 (6) E { D k T D k } = I ; E { D k T D j } ≈ diag ( r k , j ( 1 ) , r k , j ( 2 ) … r k , j ( M ) ) 
where  k ,  j ∊{1,2… n },  k  ≠  j  ;  r k , j ( 1 ) , r k , j ( 2 ) … r k , j ( M )  are the so-called canonical correlation coefficients. Thus mCCA as a preprocessing step aligns the components by a data projection that jointly maximizes the N-way correlations, making the next joint ICA step more stable. 
 Based on the linear mixture model, we consequently get the associated maps  C k  via  X k  =  D k · C k ,  C k  =  pinv ( D k )· X k . Note that multi-set CCA may achieve complete source separation in  C k  only when  r ij 1 , r ij 2 … r ij M  are sufficiently distinct( Li, et al. 2009 ). However, this constraint is not always easily satisfied, especially when the number of components  M  is large ( e.g.  >10) or the canonical correlation coefficients are very close in values, which may occur frequently in applications using real brain data, since the multimodal connection among components usually are not very high and could be similar in value ( Sui, et al. 2011 ). Therefore,  C k  will typically be a set of sources that are not completely separated. 
 Furthermore, due to the potential common correlation values among  r 1 , r 2 … r M , applying individual ICA within each dataset may also introduce ambiguity in feature matching via cross-correlation, as we showed in ( Sui, et al. 2010 ). Therefore, further applying jICA on the concatenated maps [ C 1 , C 2 ,… C n ] decomposes the mixtures transformed to an orthogonal space. Joint-ICA is a joint analysis obtained by forming an overall data input via stacking the data from different modalities together. After applying ICA algorithm, the data from each modality shared a same estimated demixing matrix W and are represented by joint independent source S = [ S 1 ,  S 2 …  S n ] in which each of the rows S k  are placed adjacent to form a total combined row with length of the total number of voxels in all features ( Calhoun, et al. 2006a ). As shown in  equation (7) , the independence among transformed components is maximized by reducing the statistical dependencies among them. ICA as a central tool for BSS has been studied extensively and we utilized Infomax ( Bell and Sejnowski 1995 ) in our work due to its well known stability and reliability when the underlying sources are mostly super-Gaussian, since the underlying brain imaging sources are expected to be sparse, leading to heavy-tailed distributions ( James and Hesse 2005 ).
 (7) [ S 1 , S 2 … S n ] = W ⋅ [ C 1 , C 2 … C n ] 
Finally,  n  sets of independent components  S k  are derived ( n =3 in our case), with their corresponding mixing matrices  A k  linked via correlation. The proposed scheme “mCCA+jICA” can be summarized as shown in  Figure 1 .
 (8) X k = ( D k ⋅ W − 1 ) ⋅ S k , A k = D k ⋅ W − 1 
 
 
 Simulation 
 According to the priority of the optimization and the analysis schemes, the existing multivariate fusion models can be reclassified into 3 main categories which are good at:
 Separating sources precisely and discovering the common mixing profiles. Finding flexible connections among modalities Enabling both flexible modal connection and high-quality source separation. 
We select one representative method from each optimization strategy to contrast them in a simulation, namely, joint ICA, multi-set CCA and mCCA+jICA. For fair comparison, all 3 methods are blind, using same features as input, thus it would be helpful to show why the findings generated by one method may not be obtained by another. 
 Eight sources were generated for each feature (modality) to simulate images or one-dimensional signals, with sizes 128×128, 1×5000, and 120×120 respectively, resulting in true sources  S 1  (in dimension of 8×16384),  S 2  (in dimension of 8×5000) and  S 3  (in dimension of 8×14400). The vector lengths were deliberately designed to be different across features/data types as is case for real data. The mixing matrices for each feature,  A 1 ,  A 2  and  A 3  (each in dimension of 80×8) were constructed with diverse correlation between their corresponding columns. The column-wise correlation values are as follows:  A 1 - A 2  = [0.77, 0.51, 0.25, 0.44, 0.42, 0.10, 0.18, 0.16],  A 2 - A 3  = [0.69, 0.36, 0.20, 0.30, 0.12, 0.05, 0.03, 0.16] and  A 1 - A 3  = [0.77, 0.41, 0.14, 0.39, 0.14, 0.12 0.09, 0.03]. Eighty noisy mixtures were generated for each feature under each of the 11 noisy conditions via  X k  =  I k  +  N k  =  A k S k  +  N k ,  k =1, 2, 3; where  I k  is the pure signal mixture and  N k  is random Gaussian noise. The corresponding mean peak signal-to-noise ratios (PSNR) are in range of [−1 20] dB. The PSNR is a most commonly used measure of image quality after corruption or recovery, which is defined as (9) for the  j th  mixture of feature  k  at every noisy condition. A typical PSNR value for acceptable image quality is about 30 dB; the lower the value, the more degraded the image ( Thomos, et al. 2006 ).
 (9) PSNR ( k , j ) = 10 log 10 [ max i ∈ [ 1 , l ] ( I k ( i ) ) 2 1 l ∑ i = 1 l ∣ X k ( i ) − I k ( i ) ∣ 2 ] , j = 1 , 2 , … , 80 ; l = { 16384 , k = 1 5000 , k = 2 14400 , k = 3 } 
 Three joint BSS models: jICA, mCCA, and mCCA+jICA were implemented on simulated datasets respectively under every PSNR for 5 runs. The decomposed components are paired with the true sources via cross-correlation automatically within each feature. We adopted three metrics to estimate the joint BSS performance:
 The average correlation of the estimated components with the true source  S ; The average correlation of the estimated mixing profiles with the true mixing profile  A ; The mean square error of the estimated column-wise correlations between  A 1 - A 2 ,  A 2 - A 3,  and  A 1 - A 3  compared to the true value. 
 In reality, the component number is unknown. To test the robustness of our model, we also varied the source numbers to be estimated on the same mixed signals  X k  under 11 increasing noise conditions. For each model, the estimated numbers were set to be either less (6), or more (10 and 12) than the number of true sources (8). To evaluate the performance, we picked the best matched 6 components from true sources when estimated numbers were set to be 6, or the best matched 8 components from BSS results when estimated numbers were larger than 8. Correlations were calculated between the selected components and their corresponding true values. 
 
 
 Human Brain Data 
 
 Participants 
 mCCA+jICA was applied to real DTI, fMRI (auditory sensorimotor task) and sMRI data collected from 213 subjects collected as part of the  Mind Clinical Imaging Consortium  (MCIC) study from four sites, as listed in  Table 1 . 
 Table 2  lists the demographic information for all subjects. Healthy controls were free from any Axis I disorder, as assessed with the SCID (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR) screening device. Patients met criteria for schizophrenia defined by the DSM-IV based on the SCID interview ( First 1995 ) and review of the associated case file by experienced raters located with each site. All patients were on stable medication prior to the fMRI scan session. A detailed medical history was not available for all subjects during this analysis and thus the examination of medication effect was omitted for this particular study. The two groups did not differ with regard to age. Significant differences were found on WRAT III (Wide-Range Achievement Test) scores, a brief screening measure for achievement and a proxy for IQ covering reading recognition, spelling, and arithmetic. Symptom scores were determined by using the Schedule for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms(SAPS) ( Andreasen 1984 ) and Negative Symptoms(SANS) ( Andreasen 1989 ). 
 
 Imaging Parameters 
 The scanners used for each modality as well as the scanning parameters at each site are listed in  Table 1 . Note that the MCIC consortium tried to match the fMRI and sMRI protocol across multi-sites but intentionally asked the sites to run their standard DTI protocols. 
 
 
 Auditory Sensorimotor Task 
 The goal of this task was to activate the auditory and somatosensory cortices robustly. Prior to the scan all subjects were instructed until they were able to perform the task adequately. The task consisted of an on/off block design. During the on-block, 200 ms tones were presented with a 500 ms stimulus onset asynchrony. There were eight tones at different pitches along a scale and they were presented in ascending and descending cycles for the duration of the ‘on’ block. No tones were presented during the ‘off’ block. Upon each presentation of the tone a subject was required to make a speeded right thumb button-press response through an MR-compatible input device. There were two runs, each lasting about 4 minutes 
 
 
 fMRI Preprocessing 
 SPM8 software package( http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8 ) was employed to perform fMRI preprocessing. Slice timing was performed with the middle slice as the reference frame. Images were realigned using INRIalign, a motion correction algorithm that is unbiased by local signal changes( Freire, et al. 2002 ). Data were then spatially normalized into the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space( Friston, et al. 1995 ) with affine transformation followed by a non-linear approach with 4×5×4 basis functions. Images (originally collected at 3.4×3.4×4 mm 3 ) were then slightly down sampled to 3×3×3 mm 3 , resulting in a data cube of 53×63×46 voxels. Finally, data were spatially smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of FWHM of 9×9×9 mm 3 . A GLM analysis consisted of a univariate multiple regression of each voxel’s time course with an experimental design matrix was used to find task-associated brain regions. We modeled the effect of interest using the tapping condition versus an implicit baseline to create a beta-weight map for the sensorimotor task. 
 
 
 DTI Preprocessing 
 DTI data were preprocessed by FMRIB Software Library (FSL;  www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl ) and consisted of the following steps: 1) Quality check 2) Motion and eddy current correction 3) Adjusting the diffusion gradient direction and 4) Feature extraction, to calculate the diffusion tensor and the fractional anisotropy (FA) maps, which were then smoothed and resized to a final 53×63×46 matrix for each subject, see more details in ( Sui, et al. 2011 ). 
 
 
 sMRI Preprocessing 
 sMRI data were also preprocessed using the SPM8 software package which was used to segment the brain into white matter (WM), GM, and cerebral spinal fluid with unmodulated normalized parameters via the unified segmentation method ( Ashburner and Friston 2005 ). After segmentation, the GM images were smoothed to a full-width half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel of 10mm ( White, et al. 2001 ) and re-sliced to a matrix of 53×63×46 voxels. Subject outlier detection was further performed using a spatial Pearson correlation with the template image, to ensure that all subjects were properly segmented, (for details, see ( Segall, et al. 2009 )). 
 
 
 Site Effect Correction and Normalization 
 After feature extraction (preprocessing), the 3D brain images of each subject were reshaped into a one-dimensional vector and stacked, forming a matrix with dimensions of 213×[number of voxels] for each of the 3 modalities. Furthermore, site effects were corrected by removing the global mean from each of the 4 sites for each modality. These 3 feature matrices were then normalized to have the same average sum-of-squares (computed across all subjects and all voxels/locus for each modality) to ensure all modalities had the same ranges. Following normalization, the relative scaling (a normalization factor) within a given data type was preserved ( i.e. , 2.71, 0.34, 0.42 for fMRI, FA, GM respectively), but the normalized input units have the same voxel-wise mean square variance for all modalities. Next, the data was processed via the pipeline shown in  Figure 1 ,  i.e. , dimension reduction-> multi-set CCA-> joint ICA-> component analysis. The component number was estimated using modified MDL( Li, et al. 2007 ) to be 9, 6, 8 for fMRI, DTI and sMRI respectively. We thus choose  M =9 for the following analysis since we have found that a slight overestimation of the component number does not adversely affect the results (as shown in  Appendix ). Note that the estimated IC number is lower than that used for fMRI data typically, since mCCA+jICA works on extracted features of interests, instead of the original imaging data. However, a considerable amount of variance is retained for the M=9 case,  i.e.,  71%, 98%, 94% for fMRI, DTI and sMRI respectively. 
 
 
 
 
 
 RESULTS 
 
 Simulation Results 
 Figure 2  compares the first two performance metrics for different noise levels ( Fig 2a , averaged across all components) and varying source distributions ( Fig 2b , averaged across 11 noise levels). It is evident that mCCA+jICA is quite robust to noise and its BSS performance was consistently the best in all noise conditions. Consequently, joint ICA was the second best in source estimation and mCCA was the second best in mixing matrix estimation; Note that when PSNR=−1dB,  i.e. , noise exceeds signal, all three methods have an estimation accuracy higher than 0.5. 
 Figure 2(c)  compared the modal-connection estimation, where the true  A 1 - A 2 ,  A 1 - A 3  and  A 2 - A 3  correlation were given by yellow bars for every source, while the mean square error and its standard derivation of the link estimation were plotted in red for mCCA and in green for mCCA+jICA. Note that both high (0.79) and low (0.07) correlation values exist in modal connections, representing shared or distinct factors among modalities. mCCA+jICA out performed mCCA again especially for sources whose have low  A i - A j  correlation values that are close to many others,  e.g.  the  A 1 - A 2  and  A 1 - A 3  correlation of source 6. 
 The performance comparison using different component numbers are listed in  Table 3 , where each correlation value was averaged across selected components for corresponding modality and method. The blue bold values indicate the best performance among three methods. It is clear that mCCA+jICA showed highest or close to highest correlations among three methods in most cases. 
 
 
 Group Differences in Human Brain Data 
 We performed two-sample t-tests on mixing coefficients of each IC for each modality. If the components of the same index show group differences in more than one modality, they are called joint group-discriminative ICs,  e.g.  IC1, IC2 and IC9, as shown in  Figure 3 . By contrast, if the component shows significant group difference only in a single modality, it is called a  modal-specific  group-discriminative IC,  e.g.  fMRI_IC4, DTI_IC3&7 in our case. We also looked into the column-wise correlations (modal-connection) between A 1 , A 2  and A 3  pair wisely, as listed in  Table 4 , where the significant correlations were marked as bold. It is interesting that the joint-discriminative ICs also indicate significant correlations (green values,  e.g.  DTI-sMRI IC9: 0.49) between their mixing profiles. 
 
 
 Correlation with Behavior Information 
 The derived mixing coefficients  A  also provide a way to investigate the relationship between the identified components and subjects’ behavioral data, such as duration of illness (DOI) and SANS/SAPS scores, which a rating scale of severity of positive, negative and general symptoms of SZ. We computed the correlation coefficient between the illness duration and the component loading parameters in the patients. Three ICs were found to be significant: FA_IC1, SMRI_IC1 and SMRI_IC3. The correlation values ( r ) and significance levels ( p ) are listed in  Table 5 . Multiple comparisons for 27 correlations were performed using FDR correction and the significant  p  values were shown in bold.  Figure 4  demonstrated the scatter plot of DOI versus ICA weights, and the linear trends. 
 We determined that the patients had a high correlation between age and DOI (Pearson  r =0.8), but with a Spearman correlation of only 0.21. If we regress age out from the  A  matrices, the residual mixing coefficients do not show significant correlations with DOI, and vice versa. For the 3 significant components: FA_IC1, SMRI_IC1 and SMRI_IC3, we also calculated their age correlation for each group. The results are as follows: schizophrenia patients showed stronger age correlation of −0.38, −0.61 and −0.46 respectively compared to their DOI correlation of −0.36, −0.51 and −0.39, while in controls corresponding age correlations were −0.26,−0.52 and −0.24. Note that the patients’ DOI correlations in FA_IC1 and SMRI_IC3 are higher than age correlations in the controls, which may suggest that the impact of DOI is much more than age for these two components. However for sMRI_IC1, age shows a strong effect which may be confounded by DOI. 
 Results for correlations with SANS/SAPS scores determined that only fMRI_IC4 (which is also a modality-specific group-discriminating IC) showed a significant correlation with negative symptom scores, as displayed in  Figure 5 . No significant correlation was found for positive symptom scores. 
 The specific identified regions of the components of interest and their abbreviations are summarized in  Table 6  for fMRI (Talairach labels),  Table 7  for DTI (white matter tracts) and  Table 8  for sMRI (MNI labels) respectively. For fMRI and sMRI, each IC is transformed into a Z map by dividing its standard deviation across all voxels, and the voxels above the threshold (∣Z∣>2.0) were converted from Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates to Talairach coordinates and entered into a database to provide anatomic and functional labels for the right (R) and left (L) hemispheres. The volume of activated voxels in each area is provided in cubic centimeters (cc). Within each area, the maximum Z value and its MNI coordinates are provided for all 3 tables. To summarize the white matter results, we used the Johns Hopkins white-matter tractography atlas (from FSL) ( Hua, et al. 2008 ), from which 20 structures were identified; mostly large bundles. In  Table 7 , the WM tract labels, the identified volume (cc) and the percentage that indicates the overlap of the identified voxels with each WM tract are listed in detail. 
 
 
 
 DISCUSSION 
 In this paper we extended the mCCA+jICA two-way fusion model to three-way or  N  way fusion, by replacing the two-way multimodal CCA with multi-set CCA. The aim of the method is to identify precise correspondence among  N  data types and make possible the investigation of both shared and distinct risk factors spanning multiple modalities for a specified brain disorder. 
 We first compared mCCA+jICA with its alternatives in simulation. From  Figure 2  and  Table 3 , it is clear that joint ICA provided better source separation than multi-set CCA, while mCCA estimated mixing matrices more precisely, especially when component number is under- or over-estimated. Interesting, when the estimated component number is higher than the ground truth, the source estimation performance might be better instead of getting hurt, while the estimation of mixing coefficients achieves best performance when  M  equals to true values. The combination of these two models mitigates the performance deficits of mCCA by using ICA to decompose the mixtures into maximally independent components; meanwhile the use of mCCA makes the job of jICA simpler and more reliable by providing a closer initial match. As shown in  Figure 2 (c) , for components with lower or closer A correlations (sources 3,6,7), mCCA+jICA consistently performs better. 
 
 Group Differences 
 The aim of the proposed model is to investigate both shared and distinct risk factors spanning multiple modalities for brain disorders, and also to identify potential correspondences among  N  modalities. These aims were validated in our results that showed both joint and modality-specific components discriminated between patients and controls. It was also encouraging to find that the joint-discriminative ICs showed significant correlations between their mixing profiles (see  table 3 ). In particular, DTI_IC9 and sMRI_IC9 had the highest inter-modality correlation of 0.49 and both were group-discriminative, which suggests that connections between GM regions in the motor cortex and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) are influenced by WM tracts within the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and corticospinal tract (CST), and that these connections may be altered in schizophrenia. This WM-GM linkage is supported by ( Hua, et al. 2009 ) via fiber tracking and cortical mapping, where motor cortex was assigned as the cortical region based on fiber association with CST and SLF. Note that in our study we did not perform WM tractography but provide a type of summary statistic. A major strength of mCCA+jICA is that it can discover changes in one modality ( e.g .) causing related alterations in distant, but connected regions in other modalities, without requiring a direct link. 
 Furthermore, IC 1 significantly differentiated SZ from HC in all three modalities, suggesting that schizophrenia deficits may lie in visual cortex function (fMRI), anterior thalamic radiation (ATR) and forceps minor (FMIN) WM tracts (DTI), and in the structure of the parietal cortex, cuneus and thalamus (sMRI), and that these identified regions may share some underlying relationship. ( Schlosser, et al. 2007 ) reported on a direct correlation in schizophrenia patients between the frontal FA reduction and fMRI activation in regions in the occipital and prefrontal cortex. Moreover, visual cortex impairments ( Brenner, et al. 2009 ;  Sui, et al. 2009 ), reduced parietal cortical thickness ( Borgwardt, et al. 2008 ;  Zhou, et al. 2007 ), and DTI abnormities in ATR ( Lewis 2000 ;  Sussmann, et al. 2009 ) have been reported previously in schizophrenia. Furthermore, visual cortex implicates cuneus on sMRI and several visual cortical areas on fMRI with a mixing correlation of 0.25. As reported in ( Calhoun, et al. 2008 ;  Calhoun, et al. 2012 ) the intrinsic brain networks such as visual networks are often identified during resting fMRI scan; however, they are also present during (and modulated by) the performance of a task. This is consistent with our finding in that both task-related (motor and temporal) and non-task related (visual) brain networks were able to be identified in this auditory oddball task. Finally, sMRI_IC1 and DTI_IC1 results correspond nicely to findings in ( Douaud, et al. 2007 ) where the abnormalities in the primary sensorimotor and premotor cortices and in white matter CST tracts are detected jointly. This structural pair has a high inter-modality correlation of 0.407 and both components show significant correlation with DOI. The identified abnormal white matter tracts including ATR, SLF, and inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus (IFO) correspond to the deficits discovered in thalamus, parietal lobe and DLFPC in grey matter. Our results suggest that the anisotropy changes may relate to the functional/structural changes in brain connectivity that are thought to play a central role in the clinical expression of schizophrenia. 
 FMRI_IC2 and DTI_IC2 are another pair of joint discriminating components that depict a set of functional-anatomical “connected” regions that have been previously implicated as in schizophrenia, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), motor cortex and thalamus in fMRI, and ATR, CST and SLF in DTI. The DLPFC plays an important role in the integration of sensory and mnemonic information, action regulation and executive function. Researchers have frequently reported dysfunction and lack of functional connectivity of this region in schizophrenia ( Badcock, et al. 2005 ;  Hamilton, et al. 2009 ). The thalamus has multiple functions and is believed to act as a relay station between many subcortical areas and the cerebral cortex. Thalamic abnormalities have also been associated with SZ ( Danos 2004 ). Correspondingly, DTI_IC2 indicates an FA reduction in ATR that projects from the anterior and medial regions of the thalamus to the frontal lobe. In addition, the CST, which subserves motor control, and the SLF, which connects the parietal to frontal lobe also show a decrease in FA. These findings are in agreement with previously reported FA abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia ( Anand, et al. 2009 ;  Douaud, et al. 2007 ;  Schlosser, et al. 2007 ), suggesting that disrupted white matter connectivity may contribute to coordinated brain dysfunction, especially in the frontal lobe, which frequently is hypothesized to be “disconnected” from other brain regions in schizophrenia ( Williams, et al. 2004 ). 
 We also identified ICs of interest showing significance only in one modality, such as fMRI_IC4 (pink frame), which include superior temporal gyrus (STG) and motor cortex, consistent with findings in most schizophrenia studies using an auditory sensorimotor task that requires subjects to push buttons. STG plays a prominent role in schizophrenia. It has been identified as one of the most group-discriminating region for controls versus schizophrenia patients in auditory tasks such as sensorimotor paradigm ( Demirci, et al. 2008 ;  Sui, et al. 2009 ) and its dysfunction has been related to the auditory hallucinations that are common in schizophrenia ( Calhoun, et al. 2004 ). In addition, motor activation deficits in schizophrenia are also frequently reported ( Schroder, et al. 1999 ) . 
 
 
 Correlation with Duration of Illness 
 Three components showed a decreasing trend of GM/FA values with duration of illness. The gray matter changes can either be interpreted as the result of locally reduced cortical thickness or as manifestations of altered gyrification patterns. The reduction of anisotropy could produce connectivity disruption in WM fiber tracts and/or the reduction in tract coherence and direction. Both kinds of disruption are correlated with illness duration in schizophrenia. The identified GM regions in SMRI_IC1&3 are mainly located in parietal, frontal and temporal lobes and cerebellum, consistent with ( Premkumar, et al. 2008 ;  Premkumar, et al. 2006 ), in which lower GM volumes in DLPFC, fusiform gyrus and cerebellum are associated with both a long DOI and aging in SZ. In addition, the detected ATR and CST tracts in DTI_IC1 are mostly located in frontal and parietal lobes, consistent with ( Kyriakopoulos, et al. 2009 ;  White, et al. 2009 ) in that WM abnormalities in adult SZ are found in frontal and parietal lobes and may depend on developmental stage at the time of illness onset. 
 
 
 Correlation with Negative Symptoms 
 One fMRI component, fMRI_IC4, showed an inverse correlation  r =−0.224 with negative symptoms ( p =0.029, but this did not pass the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparison). Negative symptoms refer to the weakening or lack of normal thoughts, emotions or behavior in schizophrenia ( Andreasen and Olsen 1982 ) and are prominent in about a third of patients ( Makinen, et al. 2008 ). Note that the superior temporal gyrus and motor cortex involved in fMRI_IC4 represents only the task-related brain activation associated with the sensorimotor task, implying that increasing negative symptom severity may influence functional task performance, consistent with ( Cannon, et al. 2002 ;  Wolf, et al. 2008 ), where negative symptom severity was inversely correlated with either premotor area activation or GM deficits in STG and premotor cortex. In addition, ( Ribolsi, et al. 2010 ) reported that connectivity between dorsal premotor cortex and contra-lateral primary motor cortex was dysfunctional in schizophrenia and correlated with negative symptoms. 
 
 
 Future extensions 
 In this paper we develop and evaluate a novel multivariate method that can explore cross-information in multiple (more than two) data types and applied it to compare schizophrenia patients to controls using an fMRI-DTI-sMRI combination. This is a novel attempt to perform a fusion of three different imaging modalities. The method described here could be applied straightforwardly to study other brain diseases (or subsets of a particular illness, such as psychotic or non-psychotic bipolar disorder). In addition, the choice of which multimodal data types to utilize is flexible. The “mCCA+jICA” approach is also suitable for resting-state fMRI, e.g., on could use ICA components or the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) derived from resting-state fMRI as input ( Calhoun, et al. 2012 ). Such measures have been used previously for default mode or other applications using pair-wise joint ICA (and variants such as constrained-coefficient ICA and parallel ICA) in multiple papers, including ( Kim, et al. 2010 ;  Meda, et al. 2010 ;  Smith, et al. 2009 ;  Wu, et al. 2010 ). Finally the proposed method is very computationally efficient (requiring only a couple of minutes to analyze hundreds of subjects). It is thus possible to use the identified group-discriminative components to generate features (e.g. the Z map above certain threshold) and train a classifier, which is able to predict independent data sets (or a single subject) and serve as potential biomarkers. However, note that fusing as many modalities as possible in the training sample is not necessary result in the best classification result, as reported in ( Zhang, et al. 2012 ) thus it would be good to compare a combination of unimodal and multimodal results, as we did in ( Kim, et al. 2010 ). We plan to pursue this possibility in future work. 
 Compared to the two-way mCCA+jICA fusion approach introduced in ( Sui, et al. 2011 ), N-way fusion of brain imaging data is more challenging since it is trying to discover any patterns of related change that may be present across multiple data sets of different types. In order to achieve both flexible inter-modal associations and good source separation, performing N-way multi-set CCA on multiple datasets can be more restrictive than two-way multimodal CCA, since we are maximizing the sum of the squared correlations among all pair-wise modal combinations instead of only maximizing correlation of two modalities. This may result in mixing matrices  A k  which are not strictly correlated only at the same indices in order to find a global solution for all modalities. However, this can also be more informative since we automatically balance information from very different modalities. The results we found using both real and simulated data show that this does not impact the separation analysis adversely; instead, the combination of mCCA and jICA improves the joint BSS performance. Furthermore, while the cost functions for multi-set CCA can have different versions as reported in ( Li, et al. 2009 ), we only adopted one cost function version. These different cost functions can yield similar results but also generate somewhat different decompositions, thus to compare the performance of different multi-set CCA models is a future direction as well. 
 A possible limitation of this work is that the results might be impacted by the fMRI task employed to probe brain function. Other tasks may yield different couplings and reveal different abnormalities. Indeed, one might expect such differences across tasks, as each task access a unique pattern of functional and structural brain networks. Future work may examine resting state fMRI data to investigate effects of functional-structural coupling. In addition, mCCA+jICA operates on extracted features, rather than the original imaging data, ( e.g.  using 3D contrast images instead of 4D fMRI data). Although some of the temporal information was lost using this method, a “feature” tends to be more tractable than working with the large-scale original data due to the reduced number of dimensions ( Calhoun and Adali 2009 ) and provides a simpler space in which to link the data ( Smith, et al. 2009 ). Another limitation of this method and a challenge for studying schizophrenia and bipolar patients in general, is that most participants were receiving antipsychotic and/or mood stabilizing medication at the time of scanning, which result in both structural and functional brain alterations ( Ho, et al. 2011 ;  Lui, et al. 2010 ) and medication doses were not recorded for all subjects. Furthermore, structural imaging studies typically use dose years of medication for the analyses, whereas fMRI studies typically use current dose, as there is a time scale difference in function/structure effects of medication. Finally, subjects were recruited from multiple sites in order to increase the statistical power needed to elucidate effects, however the multi-site/multi-scanner effects may also be introduced. To mitigate this issue we removed the main effect of site for each modality during processing. We also checked the interactions between site and group and found no significant effects ( p =0.93, 0.32, 0.78 for fMRI, DTI and sMRI respectively). 
 Multimodal brain imaging data has shown increasing utility in answering both scientifically interesting and clinically relevant questions. As well as providing the conceptual glue to bind together data from multiple types or levels of analysis, the related computational methods are also valuable for clinical research on the mechanisms of disease progression. In this real-world fusion application, we highlighted data from brain function, white matter and gray matter in data from schizophrenia and healthy control subjects. We identified both modality-common and modality-specific group-discriminating aspects that verified the abnormalities in schizophrenia and replicated and extended previous findings. Such observations add to our understanding of the neural correlates of schizophrenia. The proposed model promises a widespread utilization in the neuroimaging community and may be used to identify potential brain illness biomarkers.

 Appendix 
 The following simulation assumes the data from different modality has different component numbers:  M 1 , M 2 , M 3 , and test using which number of  M , the “MCCA+jICA” can achieve better performance. For each modality, we calculate the estimation accuracy of min( M, M i )  number of components that are most similar to ground truth. The estimation accuracy includes mean source correlation with ground truth and mean mixing matrix correlation with ground truth. The sources and mixing matrices used here are all from the simulation shown in the paper.

 Summary:  In both cases, MCCA+jICA works either best or close to the best among 3 methods when  M≥max( M 1 , M 2 , M 3 ) , and using a high order of component number in joint separation does not hurt the separation, instead, the estimation accuracy tends to increase with  M (check the table vertically, the correlation values raise). Therefore we choose  M=max( M 1 , M 2 , M 3 )  in our application. This is different from our previous application fusing two modalities (FMRI and DTI)( Sui, et al. 2011 ), where  M  was determined min( M 1 , M 2 ). This might because the optimization function of multi-set CCA is different from that of two-way multi-modal CCA.

 Propose a general, flexible  N -way multimodal fusion model based on “mCCA+jICA” 
 A novel 3-way fMRI-DTI-sMRI fusion to discriminate schizophrenia(213 subjects) Identification of both modal-common and modal-unique group-discriminative aspects 
 Provides a way to study the relationships of brain patterns with cognitive measures

 Three-way “mCCA+jICA” fusion strategy for real human brain data 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 2 
 
 Comparison of joint ICA, multi-set CCA and mCCA+jICA approaches in a simulated 3-way fusion. The first two performance metrics(source estimation accuracy and mixing matrix( A ) estimation accuracy) were compared in different noisy levels measured by peak signal to noise ratio(PSNR) in (a) and different source distributions in (b). Note that the acceptable image quality is usually with PSNR>30dB. Figure 2(c) compared the modal-connection estimation, where the true  A 1 - A 2 ,  A 1 - A 3  and  A 2 - A 3  correlation were given by yellow bars for every source, while the mean square error and its standard derivation of the link estimation were plotted in red for mCCA and in green for mCCA+jICA. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 3 
 
 Summary of joint and modal-specific group-discriminative ICS(p<0.05) IC 1 is significant for all three modalities. IC 2 is significant for fMRI and DTI, while IC 9 is significant for DTI and sMRI. They are called joint discriminative ICs (green frame) as they can differentiate SZ from HC in more than 2 modalities. Note that the joint ICs also show significant correlations berween their matching mixing matrices, see  Table 1 . In addition, fMRI,_IC4, DTI_IC3 and DTI_IC7 only show significance within one modality, they are called modal-specific discriminative ICs(pink frame). Hence our model enables us to capture components of interest that are either common or distinct acorss modalities.

 Each IC is transformed into Z score and the voxels with ∣Z∣>2.0 were converted to Talairach coordinates, providing anatomic labels for the right (R) and left (L) hemispheres. The volume of activated voxels in each area is provided in cubic centimeters (cc). Within each area, the maximum Z value and its MNI coordinates are listed.
