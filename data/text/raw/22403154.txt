Results are discussed as they relate to a social cognitive and affective neuroscience view of self-esteem. self-referential processing implicit social cognition self-esteem INTRODUCTION Trait self-esteem, or the tendency to evaluate oneself positively rather than negatively, is a robust predictor of mental health and well-being ( Baumeister  et al. , 2003 ). Neuroimaging studies strongly implicate the medial prefrontal cortex (ventral and dorsal), cingulate gyrus (anterior and posterior), precuneus and temporoparietal cortex (reviews by  Qin and Northoff, 2011 ;  Qin  et al. , 2012a ;  van der Meer  et al. , 2010 ) in mediating our ability to consciously reflect about ourselves, that is, self-referential processing (SRP;  Northoff  et al. , 2006 ). However, little is known about the neural bases mediating individual differences in valenced SRP, that is, why most people tend to think about themselves positively, whereas others regard themselves negatively, cognitive and affective processes that are intrinsic to self-esteem. Previous studies investigating valenced SRP measured neural response while healthy participants explicitly judged the self-descriptiveness of trait adjectives (e.g. ‘liked’  vs  ‘disliked’, ‘success’  vs  ‘failure’) ( Fossati  et al. , 2003 ;  Moran  et al. , 2006 ;  Yoshimura  et al. , 2009 ) or self-relevance of valenced pictures ( Phan  et al. , 2004 ;  Lemogne  et al. , 2011 ), tasks not unlike completing a self-esteem questionnaire within the scanner. However, healthy individuals typically endorse positive stimuli (e.g. the words ‘liked’, ‘success’) as more self-descriptive than negative stimuli (e.g. ‘disliked’, ‘failure’) ( Mezulis  et al. , 2004 ), confounding valence with self-descriptiveness, and rendering these designs less sensitive to detecting neural processes mediating negatively valenced SRP. Limitations inherent to the use of direct survey-based measures of SRP also include susceptibility to self-presentational biases and the likelihood that not all valenced self-representations are fully accessible to conscious reflection (e.g.  Gawronski, 2009 ). To circumvent these concerns, priming methodologies are increasingly used in experimental social psychology as indirect measures of associations between valence and self-representation (reviews by  Buhrmester  et al. , 2011 ;  Zeigler-Hill and Jordan, 2010 ). However, no previous studies have utilized these methods in order to assess the neural processes mediating valenced SRP (for a study examining implicit SRP of stimuli that were not overtly valenced, however, see  Moran  et al. , 2009 ). The present study addressed the above limits of past literature by directly comparing the neural correlates of valenced SRP with valenced ‘other-referential processing’ (ORP) using a priming methodology. Specifically, to obviate the effect of the self-positivity bias, we previously designed a ‘Visual–Verbal Self-Other Referential Processing Task’ (VV-SORP-T; see  Figure 1 ) that directly engenders valenced SRP and ORP ( Frewen and Lundberg, 2012 ). The VV-SORP-T requires participants to covertly rehearse the words ‘ I am ’ or ‘ He/She is ’ when presented with either their own or another person’s picture and then read positive or negative words, thereby experimentally engendering an association between the self/other and positivity/negativity on different trials (e.g. ‘I am’ … ‘disliked’). The encoded representation (e.g. ‘I am’ … ‘disliked’) may or may not match individuals’ internal self-representations (e.g. ‘I am’ … ‘liked’) as determined by individual differences in trait self-esteem. Participants monitor and report their affective response to the task, the outcome of which we further interpret as partly reflecting the match between the task-induced encoded representation and internal representations. Specifically, matching negative self-representations (e.g. ‘I am’ … ‘disliked’) are more likely to engender negative affect and matching positive self-representations (e.g. ‘I am’ … ‘liked’) are more likely to engender positive affect. The impact of the task on cognitive processing is also measured indirectly via response time (RT) providing a conjoint passive button-pressing requirement. We previously demonstrated in young adults that the VV-SORP-T is sensitive to individual differences in valenced SRP such that individuals with lower explicit self-esteem (as indexed by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale;  Rosenberg, 1965 ) are more likely to experience negative affect during negative SRP, less likely to experience positive affect during positive SRP, and evidence slower RT particularly during negative SRP ( Frewen and Lundberg, 2012 ).
 Fig. 1 Illustration of one block of the VV-SORP-T. The individual shown in the photograph is the second author. Participants posed for their own photographs in neutral expression as for a passport application. Photographs of strangers (‘other’-condition) were taken from the NimStim set ( Tottenham  et al. , 2009 ) and matched to the participant as closely as possible for the following attributes: ethnicity, hair colour and hair length. Participants viewed the photographs and silently rehearsed ‘I am’ (for the self) or ‘She is’ (for the other), and then silently read the words, thus associating the self/other with positivity/negativity on different trials. In the present fMRI study we investigated the neural correlates of cognitive and affective processes relating to individual differences in self-esteem by examining variability in the BOLD response to the VV-SORP-T in 20 women. Consistent with previous research, we expected relatively few differences between valenced SRP and valenced ORP at the group level ( Yoshimura  et al. , 2009 ). However, we hypothesized that individual differences in valenced adjective endorsement, and affective responses to the VV-SORP-T, would predict between-person variation in the BOLD response within regions of interest including within the medial prefrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, temporoparietal cortex and amygdala. METHODS Participants Twenty women varying from young to middle adulthood (18–52 years, M age = 27.80, s.d. = 8.33) recruited by advertisement from the general community took part in this study. Participants’ ethnic status was distributed as follows: European–Caucasian ( n  = 12, 60%), East Indian ( n  = 3, 15%), Asian ( n  = 2, 10%), African ( n  = 2, 10%) and Middle Eastern ( n  = 1, 5%). As a group, participants reported normative levels of trait self-esteem [Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale ( Rosenberg, 1965 ): M = 22.61, s.d. = 6.01, Range 13–30] and self-critical thinking [Cognitive Distortion Scale–Self-Criticism subscale ( Briere, 2000 ); M = 14.22, s.d. = 6.25, Range 8 – 33]. Current or past psychiatric history, head injury with loss of consciousness and left-handedness were study exclusion criteria as assessed by structured clinical interviews. VV-SORP-T The VV-SORP-T involved three components: (i) completion of a paper-and-pencil survey asking about the descriptiveness of negative and positive traits for the self  vs  others (completed outside scanning), (ii) completion of an experimental task while undergoing fMRI and (iii) a post-task rating questionnaire asking about affective responses (completed outside scanning). The instructions given for the VV-SORP-T are reported verbatim in supplementary data to our prior report ( Frewen and Lundberg, 2012 ). Approximately 2 weeks prior to scanning, within a battery of related questionnaires, participants rated for each of 10 positive and 10 negative words ‘how much each word describes (i) how you think about yourself, and describes (ii) how you think about other people, in general’ on 11-point (0–10) scales anchored by ‘Not at all’ (0), ‘Moderately’ (5) and ‘Completely’ (10). The adjective list was the same as that used in  Frewen and Lundberg (2012) , originally based on that used in  Frewen  et al.  (2011) , and covered social (e.g. loved, rejected) and achievement-related (e.g. successful, incompetent) themes. We conceptualize such scores as indicative of trait self-esteem and consistent with that assumption adjective endorsement scores correlated  r  = 0.73 with Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale scores in our prior study ( Frewen and Lundberg, 2012 ). We did not purposely match the negative and positive word sets we used for frequency of general use as this would have violated natural usage within the English language ( Loumann  et al. , 2012 ), nor did we seek to equate the word sets for salience as this would also be contrary to norms (e.g.  Baumeister  et al. , 2001 ). Nevertheless,  post hoc  comparisons revealed the word sets to be statistically comparable in terms of length in letters, frequency of use within the English language relative Hyperspace Analogue of Language (HAL) norms ( Lund and Burgess, 1996 ), as well as normed mean reaction time in lexical decision and naming, all as investigated and compiled within the English Lexicon Project ( Balota  et al. , 2007 ; number of letters,  P  = 0.24; normed frequency of use,  P  = 0.42; log-frequency of use,  P  = 0.69; RT in lexical decision,  P  = 0.23; RT in naming,  P  = 0.27). Furthermore, no differences were observed in arousal ratings relative to the Affective Norms for English Words ( Bradley and Lang, 1999 ) for the subset of the words we used that are contained therein ( n  = 12 of 20;  P  = 0.27). Figure 1  illustrates how the experimental component of the VV-SORP-T was conducted. Participants’ photographs were taken in neutral expression (instructions were to pose ‘as if for a passport photograph’) using a standard-use electronic camera (4.1 megapixels) against an off-white office wall. Photographs were then standardized in order to match in essential respects those used in the development of the NimStim set of facial expressions ( Tottenham  et al. , 2009 ). The latter were used as pictures for a comparison ‘other’ (i.e. a female was selected from the NimStim set for each study participant, matched as closely as possible for ethnicity, hair colour and hair length). Before beginning the VV-SORP-T participants were habituated to the photographs for 6–10 s (as desired) in order to reduce their novelty, with the ‘other’ instructed to be regarded as ‘a typical person they might meet in their day-to-day life but presently do not know personally’. This manipulation was intended to limit error associated with responding to specific persons as has been used in previous fMRI studies (e.g. individual differences in how one regards former American President George Bush;  Kelley  et al. , 2002 ). Instructions underscored that completing the VV-SORP-T would require participants ‘to do three things: 1) internally rehearse statements and read words, 2) press response buttons on a keypad, and 3) all the while pay close attention to how you are feeling throughout the different parts of the task’. Participants were instructed to view a fixation cross (presented for 12 s in between task-blocks) until they were presented with the word ‘SELF’ or ‘OTHER’ (for 3 s) signalling which of the respective pictures they were about to see. Upon seeing their own or the other person’s photograph (also presented for 3 s), they silently rehearsed to themselves ‘I am’ or ‘She is’, respectively, and then pressed a keypad button with either their index or middle finger (counter-balanced). Participants were then presented with a single positive or negative word for 3 s, asked to silently read the word and then pressed another keypad button with their other finger. Four additional pictures and words were then presented following the same ‘picture-then-word’ rotation, with the identical picture displayed in all cases, and the words being of common valence. Therefore the stimulus presentations were blocked in terms of the conditions Reference (Self  vs  Other, i.e. photographs) and Valence (words), creating four trial types: self-negative (S-N), self-positive (S-P), other-negative (O-N) and other-positive (O-P). Participants were not instructed that they ‘should try to press the buttons as fast as possible’ as is often done in social cognition experiments. In contrast, participants were instructed only to press the buttons ‘so that we can assess afterwards whether you are paying attention to and completing the task’. This passive orientation was intended to focus attention towards introspection and interoception with participants reminded repeatedly of the importance of ‘paying close attention to how you are feeling throughout the different parts of the task’. While undergoing FMRI, participants were presented with eight-blocks in each of three 6-min runs in which the self and other photographs were presented in combination with two negative and two positive word lists. The order of the eight blocks within runs was fully randomized within and across participants. A full 6-min practice run was also completed outside of the scanner in an office setting ∼30 min before scanning in order to normalize participants to the task. Immediately after completing the experimental task component and exiting the scanner, participants were asked open-ended and percentage rating-scale questions about their response to the four experimental conditions (S-N, S-P, O-N, O-P). The percentage rating-scale asked participants to rate from 0 (‘Not at all’) to 100% (‘Strongly’), with 50% indicating ‘Moderately’, ‘ … how much you felt certain specific feelings in response to each picture and word type combination’. Ratings were provided for the following five negative affective states: ‘Anger’, ‘Sad’, ‘Anxiety-Fear’, ‘Disgust’, ‘Bad About Self’, and for two positive affective states: ‘Happy’ and ‘Good about Self’. As previously noted we conceptualize affective responses to the task as providing an additional measure of relevance to individual differences in self-esteem-related processes. Specifically, our prior study observed that individuals with lower trait self-esteem reported experiencing greater negative affect during S-N trials, and lesser positive affect during S-P trials ( Frewen and Lundberg, 2012 ). Results for quantitative ratings collected from the present sample are presented herein and open-ended comments are included as  Supplementary Table S1 . Procedure All procedures were approved by the health sciences research ethics board of Western University in London, Ontario, Canada. As noted previously, participants were assessed for study inclusion criteria and completed a short questionnaire battery including the adjective rating component of the VV-SORP-T ∼2 weeks prior to scanning. Participants completed a single-block practice version of the experimental component of the VV-SORP-T in an office setting ∼30 min prior to fMRI scanning, and three blocks of the experimental component of the VV-SORP-T while undergoing fMRI. Participants then rated their affective response to the VV-SORP-T immediately post-scan. The entire experiment took ∼75 min to complete. Imaging took place at the Robarts Research Institute in London, Ontario, Canada. All imaging data were collected using a 3.0 Tesla whole-body MRI scanner (Magnetom Tim Trio, Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) with the manufacturer’s 32-channel phased array head coil. Orthogonal scout images were collected and used to prescribe a tri-dimensional T1-weighted anatomical image of the whole head with 1 mm isotropic resolution (MP-RAGE, TR/TE/TI = 2300/2.98/900 ms, flip angle = 9°, FOV ( x ,  y ,  z ) = 256 × 240 × 192 mm, acc. factor = 4, total acq. time = 3 min 12 s). The anatomical volume was used to determine the angle of the transverse plane passing through both the anterior and posterior commeasures mid-sagittaly and as the source image for inter-individual spatial normalization. A set of 64 contiguous, 2 mm thick imaging planes for BOLD fMRI were prescribed parallel to the AC – PC plane and positioned to ensure coverage of the top of the brain. BOLD fMRI images were acquired with the manufacturer’s standard gradient echo EPI pulse sequence (single-shot blipped EPI) using an interleaved slice acquisition order and tri-dimensional prospective acquisition correction (3D-PACE). EPI volumes were acquired with 2 mm isotropic resolution and the following parameters: FOV = 192 × 192 mm, 94 × 94 matrix, TR/TE = 3000/20 ms, flip angle = 90°, 64 slices, 178 measurements. Before completing the VV-SORP-T while undergoing fMRI a ‘resting-state’ functional scan of each participant’s brain was also acquired, to be described elsewhere. Data preparation and statistical analysis Across blocks and runs for each of the four experimental conditions (S-N, S-P, O-N, O-P), VV-SORP-T survey scores were summed, and button-press RT and affect ratings were averaged. The effect of experimental condition on each of these variables was examined by ANOVA with results reported in  Table 1 .

For paired comparisons between conditions, the effect size  d′  is noted. Multivariate tests were statistically significant for Reference,  F (4,15) = 11.56,  P  < 0.001, η 2  < 0.76, Valence,  F (4,15) = 139.05,  P  < 0.001, η 2  = 0.97 and Reference-x-Valence,  F (4,15) = 8.14,  P  = 0.001, η 2  = 0.69. For survey endorsement, the results of univariate ANOVA were: Reference,  F (1,18) = 11.79,  P  = 0.003, η 2  = 0.40, Valence,  F (1,18) = 458.64,  P  < 0.001, η 2  = 0.96 and Reference-x-Valence,  F (1,18) = 20.47,  P  < 0.001 η 2  = 0.53. For negative affect (NA) ratings, the results of univariate ANOVA were: Reference,  F (1,18) = 0.04,  P  = 0.85, η 2  < 0.01, Valence,  F (1,18) = 25.11,  P  < 0.001, η 2  = 0.58 and Reference-x-Valence,  F (1,18) = 0.00,  P  = 0.99, η 2  < 0.01.

Finally, for RT (ms), the results of univariate ANOVA were: Reference,  F (1,18) = 3.04,  P  = 0.10, η 2  = 0.14, Valence,  F (1,18) = 1.73,  P  = 0.21, η 2  = 0.09 and Reference-x-Valence,  F (1,18) = 0.18,  P  = 0.68, η 2  = 0.01. Analyses of the BOLD signal were conducted via SPM8 (Welcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, University College, London, UK). Standard preprocessing was conducted within SPM8, with volumes realigned to the first functional image acquired (unidirectional movements were <4 mm from origin in all cases), normalized to a common EPI template [rendering 2 mm 3  voxels in accordance with the coordinate system of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)], and data smoothed across 8 mm (FWHM). A canonical haemodynamic response function was modelled as a response to each stimulus in individual participants (first-level), with group-averaged results evaluated as random effects (second-level). The BOLD response observed during each of the four task trials relative to between-block fixation was examined via the general linear model. Planned contrasts also compared response occurring during S-N relative to S-P trials, S-N relative to O-N trials, and S-P relative to O-P trials, thus examining the effects of Valence within Reference, and Reference within Valence. Group-averaged results for these contrasts are reported in  Table 2  and  Figure 2 . We also report the results of main effect contrasts for Reference and Valence in  Supplementary Table S2  and  Supplementary Figures F1 and F2 .

Of primary interest to this study, however, was a multiple regression analysis associating individual differences in survey and affective response scores with between-participant variability in the BOLD contrast between S-N trials and both fixation and O-N trials, and S-P trials and both fixation and O-P trials. Note that we preferred to evaluate BOLD correlations with adjective endorsement rather than Rosenberg Self-Esteem scores in this study, which allowed direct examination of associations between response to a common stimulus set (words) evaluated in differing contexts (i.e. paper-and-pencil survey rating of self and other descriptiveness  vs  performance of the experimental component of the VV-SORP-T). Results concerning individual differences are reported in  Tables 3  and  4 , and  Figures 3  and  4 .

We report within Tables clusters of size  k  ≥ 67 voxels (approximating the volume of the smoothing kernel) with uncorrected voxel-wise  P  < 0.005 as a criterion selected so as to balance risk against type-I and type-II errors ( Lieberman and Cunningham, 2009 ). To examine the location of BOLD responses we observed in relation to previous studies, we also report the number of voxels that fell within an 8-mm radius (equally the smoothing kernel) of coordinates reported in recent meta-analyses of SRP ( van der Meer  et al. , 2010 ;  Qin and Northoff, 2011 ;  Qin  et al. , 2012a ) and key study results ( Phan  et al. , 2004 ;  Moran  et al. , 2006 ;  Lemogne  et al. , 2009 ,  2011 ;  Yoshimura  et al. , 2009 ); an ROI for the left and right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) was also prescribed from  van Overwalle’s (2009)  meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies of social cognition (as calculated in  Frewen  et al. , 2010 ). Voxels in ROI analyses include those exhibiting  P  < 0.05 after correction for multiple comparisons (family-wise error rate) within the indicated centred spherical search volume, denoted  k SVC  for Small-Volume Corrected. Cluster loci are labelled by the voxel exhibiting maximal effect size within MNI space. RESULTS Self-report, experiential and behavioural response Table 1  reports the descriptive and inferential statistics describing self-report and behavioural response to the VV-SORP-T. Replicating previous results ( Frewen and Lundberg, 2012 ), survey endorsements were higher for S-P as compared with O-P ( d ′ = 1.04), consistent with the self-positivity bias. Positive affect was also higher during S-P than O-P trials ( d ′ = 1.21), although negative affect was not significantly higher during S-N than O-N trials ( d ′ = 0.02). Finally, RT was marginally slower during S-N than O-N trials ( d ′ = 0.35), and during S-P than O-P trials ( d ′ = 0.15). Further replicating previous results ( Frewen and Lundberg, 2012 ), participants who described themselves more positively (S-P survey endorsement) experienced less negative affect during S-N trials ( r  = −0.77,  P  < 0.001), less negative affect during S-P trials ( r  = −0.57,  P  = 0.006) and greater positive affect during S-P trials ( r  = 0.52,  P  = 0.011). In comparison, associations between S-N survey endorsement and affective responses were non-significant. fMRI-BOLD response Group-level differences between trial types Figure 2  and  Table 2  report significant responses observed as specific to each of the four distinct trial types at the group level in comparison with between-block fixation (in  Figure 2 , S-N = red, S-P = green, O-N = magenta, O-P = yellow). S-N trials activated three clusters: the posterior mid-cingulate (at ROI 0, −13, 31,  Moran  et al. , 2006 ;  k SVC  = 66), right superior parietal cortex and dorsal ACC-MPFC (at ROI −3, 19, 38,  Moran  et al. , 2006 ;  k SVC  = 32). S-P trials activated two clusters: ventral MPFC and left middle frontal cortex. O-P trials activated two clusters: right DLPFC and right temporal pole. Finally, response during O-N trials was more distributed, with the maximal effect size observed within the right posterior insula, and additional activations observed within the left posterior insula, right middle frontal gyrus (at ROI 50, 24, 10,  Moran  et al. , 2006 ;  k SVC  = 28), left middle frontal gyrus (at ROI −56, 15, 10,  Moran  et al. , 2006 ;  k SVC  = 132), left precentral gyrus, left posterior mid-cingulate and left cuneus. Planned contrasts examining the effects of Valence within SRP and Reference within Valence are also reported in  Table 2 . S-N trials were associated with greater response than S-P trials within two regions: the posterior mid-cingulate and right superior parietal cortex. In contrast, S-P trials were not associated with greater response in comparison with S-N trials in any brain region, and contrasts of Reference within Valence were non-significant. Individual differences in response to S-N trials Table 3  and  Figure 3  report correlations between self-report and affective responses, on the one hand, and response during S-N trials, relative to both between-block fixation and O-N trials, on the other. Concerning the contrast S-N > fixation, a positive correlation was observed between how negatively participants regarded themselves and response within the ventral MPFC-ACC (including within ROI 0, 22, −9,  Moran  et al. , 2006 ;  k SVC  = 26). In addition, women who rated themselves more negatively demonstrated increased response within left VMPFC (including within ROI −6, 42, −12,  Lemogne  et al. , 2011 ;  k SVC  = 7). In comparison, there were no significant correlations with variability in negative affective response. Concerning the contrast S-N > O-N, participants who regarded themselves more negatively demonstrated less response within the supplementary motor area (including within ROI −3, 14, 49,  Moran  et al. , 2006 ;  k SVC  = 61) and retrosplenial cortex. In comparison, participants who experienced greater negative affect exhibited greater response within the parahippocampal gyrus and right amygdala. Individual differences in response to S-P trials Table 4  and  Figure 4  report correlations across the whole-brain between self-report and affective responses, on the one hand, and BOLD response during S-P trials, relative to both between-block fixation and O-P trials, on the other. Concerning the contrast S-P > fixation, a negative correlation was observed between how positively participants regarded themselves and response within the right parahippocampal gyrus/amygdala and right temporal pole. A positive correlation was observed between positive affect experienced during S-P trials and response within the DMPFC (within ROI 2, 55, 17,  Yoshimura  et al. , 2009 ;  k SVC  = 87), left TPJ (within ROI −52, −56, 22,  van Overwalle, 2009 ;  k SVC  = 48) and right temporal pole. Concerning the contrast S-P > O-P, a negative correlation was observed between how positively participants regarded themselves and response within VMPFC (at ROI −3, 36, −18,  Phan  et al. , 2004 ;  k SVC  = 48), right DMPFC (at ROI 6, 27, 42,  Lemogne  et al. , 2011 ;  k SVC  = 18), left TPJ (two clusters within ROI −52, −56, 22,  van Overwalle, 2009 ;  k SVC  = 22 and 36), right temporal pole and bilateral inferior frontal gyri. In comparison, the more positive affect participants experienced during S-P trials, the greater was their response within many of the same regions, specifically VMPFC (at ROI −3, 36, −18,  Phan  et al. , 2004 ;  k SVC  = 20), DMPFC (at ROI 6, 27, 42,  Lemogne  et al. , 2011 ;  k SVC  = 35), left TPJ (within ROI −52, −56, 22,  van Overwalle, 2009 ;  k SVC  = 31), left inferior frontal gyrus, as well as within the precuneus. DISCUSSION How people represent themselves in comparison with others, and the role played by affective processing in such representations, are matters of significant interest to a social cognitive and affective neuroscience of core personality constructs including trait self-esteem. We investigated the neural correlates of self-esteem-related processes in response to the VV-SORP-T using an individual differences design. Although recent meta-analyses confirm greater response within MPFC, perigenual ACC and PCC during SRP than during ORP ( van der Meer  et al. , 2010 ;  Qin and Northoff, 2011 ;  Qin  et al. , 2012b ), individual studies using relatively neutral adjectives rarely observe this effect (e.g.  Ochsner  et al. , 2005 ; cf  Heatherton  et al. , 2006 ;  Yaoi  et al. , 2009 ).  Yoshimura  et al.  (2009) , using valenced adjectives, similarly observed few differences between SRP and ORP. Within the present study, the spatial maps obtained relative to fixation differed between valenced SRP and ORP ( Figure 2 ), while null effects were observed when conditions were directly compared, as conducted by  Yoshimura  et al.  (2009) . We speculate that the neural correlates of SRP and ORP will differ principally in so far as SRP is regarded as more affectively salient (e.g.  Tacikowski  et al. , 2011 ). In other words, we expect that trait endorsement must not only differentiate the self from others, but this result must sufficiently matter to participants to evoke corresponding differences in the BOLD signal. The use of valenced adjectives as in  Yoshimura  et al. ’s (2009)  study and the present one cannot assure this because, as was clearly the case in the present study, most participants will endorse robustly positive views of both themselves and others, leading trials requiring negative SRP and ORP to be regarded as relatively neutral and irrelevant ( Frewen and Lundberg, 2012 ). In contrast to the modal self-positivity bias, however, a certain number of participants with lower self-esteem will endorse relatively negative views of themselves and a corresponding range of affective responses when such representations are primed such as via the VV-SORP-T. Consistent with expectations, in the present study these individual differences dovetailed considerably with between-subject variability in the BOLD response within ROIs including MPFC, PCC, left temporoparietal cortex and right amygdala. These potentials for heterogeneity across subjects in experiential response to a common stimulus pattern make them well suited to the study of the neural correlates of personality and individual differences ( Varela, 1996 ;  Lutz and Thompson, 2003 ). Further knowledge about the neural underpinnings of negative SRP may also enlighten our understanding of psychiatric disorders associated with maladaptive SRP including depression ( Grimm  et al. , 2009 ;  Johnson  et al. , 2009 ;  Lemogne  et al. , 2009 ) and post-traumatic stress disorder ( Frewen  et al. , 2011 ). The present findings are consistent with and further inform current theorizing about the neural correlates of the ‘emotional self’ ( Fossati  et al. , 2003 ). In particular, it has been posited that ventral MPFC (inclusive of ventral ACC;  Moran  et al. , 2006 ;  Yoshimura  et al. , 2009 ) may be particularly associated with SRP that is affectively (and perhaps uniquely negatively) salient, whereas dorsal MPFC may be particularly involved in conscious, reflective processes that are either neutral or positive in nature ( van der Meer  et al. , 2010 ;  Heatherton, 2011 ). Consistent with previous observations, relative to fixation, we observed ventral MPFC/ACC response during negative SRP particularly in women who regarded themselves more negatively (see  Figure 2 ,  x  = 0,  z  = −10, red blobs), but dorsal MPFC response particularly in women who experienced greater positive affect during positive SRP (see  Figure 3 ,  x  = 0,  z  = +10 and +20, yellow blobs). However, when contrasting response occurring during positive SRP with positive ORP, ventral MPFC regions were particularly involved such that, interestingly, response was increased as a function of increasing positive affect but decreasing self-regard (see  Figure 2 ,  x  = 0,  z  = −20, cyan and magenta blobs, respectively). This dissociation suggests the merit of  Phan  et al. ’s (2004)  distinction between the significance of referential  vs  affective ratings and may inform interpretations regarding the ‘validity’ of direct (e.g. self-report survey)  vs  indirect (e.g. task-induced affective response) assessments of self-esteem-related processes ( Buhrmester  et al. , 2011 ;  Zeigler-Hill and Jordan, 2010 ). Our findings that decreasing self-regard predicted positive SRP response ( Figure 2  magenta) agree with the hypothesis of VMPFC involvement in negative SRP. However, the dissociation with positive affective experience within a brain region strongly associated with reward requires interpretation. One interpretation is that VMPFC response is particularly increased in mediating positive affect in individuals for which positive affect is otherwise not easily activated, such as in individuals disposed towards alexithymia ( Berthoz  et al. , 2002 ) and anhedonia ( Keedwell  et al. , 2005 ;  Harvey  et al. , 2007 ). However, that the same dissociation was observed concerning response within the left TPJ, which is widely implicated in social cognition and mentalizing (e.g.  van Overwalle, 2009 ), suggests individual differences during ORP likely complicate interpretation. Consistent with this, self-reports obtained from the present participants as well as those collected from participants in a previous study suggest that response during ORP within the VV-SORP-T represents anything but simply a neutral comparator condition ( Frewen and Lundberg, 2012 ). Investigation of individual differences in affective response during ORP as a predictor of the BOLD response could clarify this concern, but were considered beyond the scope of the present project given its focus on valenced SRP as it relates to self-esteem. It should also be noted that Lemogne and colleagues observed increasing response during SRP within dorsal MPFC in both depressed individuals ( Lemogne  et al. , 2009 ) and individuals high in trait negative affect ( Lemogne  et al. , 2011 ), which challenges a model emphasizing only the ventral MPFC in the affective aspects of SRP. Besides response within higher cortical areas, Yoshimura and colleagues recently revealed a dissociation between left  vs  right amygdala response and negative  vs  positive SRP, respectively ( Yoshimura  et al. , 2009 ). The right amygdala has also been associated with  social  emotional processing ( Britton  et al. , 2006 ;  Frewen  et al. , 2010 ;  Heatherton, 2011 ) as is inherent to the VV-SORP-T (see  Frewen and Lundberg, 2012 , for descriptions of socio-emotional responses during ORP including guilt, shame and envy). In our study, however, not only those women who experienced greater negative affect during negative SRP, but also those women who regarded themselves less positively before positive SRP, exhibited an increased right amygdala response. If right amygdala response is to be interpreted as signifying a negative self-appraisal within the context of SRP ( Yoshimura  et al. , 2009 ), our individual difference effects extend the significance of right amygdala response to positively valenced SRP. However, our results may qualify the finding in suggesting that the amygdala response may signify the outcome of the appraisal, that is, the experienced negativity of a stimulus or task, rather than the negativity inherent to the stimulus or task,  per se . In other words, even objectively positive stimuli may be responded to  as if  they are negative (e.g.  Lemogne  et al. , 2009 ,  2011 ;  Frewen  et al. , 2012a ,  b ), with the right amygdala response during SRP perhaps revealing the valence or salience of the result of that appraisal. The loci of activations observed within the present study overlapped most closely with those observed by  Moran  et al.  (2006) ,  Phan  et al.  (2004)  and  Lemogne  et al.  (2011) , the only other studies, to our knowledge, directly addressing between-subject variability in SRP using a correlational design. MPFC response within the present study was more inferior to loci summarized by recent meta-analyses (wherein  z -values are typically > 5;  van der Meer  et al. , 2010 ;  Qin and Northoff, 2011 ;  Qin  et al. , 2012a ), but consistent with that observed with the methodology of Phan  et al.  ( 2004 ; also used by  Lemogne  et al. , 2011 ). Provided current models emphasize VMPFC in the affective aspects of SRP ( van der Meer  et al. , 2010 ;  Heatherton, 2011 ), this confluence of findings for the VV-SORP-T and Phan  et al.  methodology are interesting provided that both methods likely encourage affective processing more greatly than do most other standard judgments tasks (the Phan  et al.  method through the use of arousing pictures and the VV-SORP-T by engendering an association between self and valence and encouraging attention to that association). Overlapping responses observed herein with those observed by Moran  et al.  occurred in regions that differentiated reaction time in Moran  et al. ’s study, implicating these regions in online SRP. Future neuroimaging studies might compare different SRP tasks to provide a more nuanced assessment of the specific subprocesses involved in SRP. Limitations of the present study should be addressed in future work. We recruited only female participants for the present study due to widely known gender differences in trait self-esteem and associated risk for depression ( Hyde  et al. , 2008 ); future studies may wish to directly investigate the neural basis for these gender differences. Clarity of interpretation could have been enhanced had we also administered neutral words and assessed affective response to the task not only subjectively but also via peripheral physiological measures of arousal. It should further be noted that contrasts of both SRP and ORP with passive fixation may be underpowered due to similarity between the neural processes involved in SRP, ORP and the passive resting state ( Qin and Northoff, 2011 ); inclusion of active control tasks other than passive fixation would be useful in future studies, which might utilize a rest-stimulus interaction paradigm to examine valenced SRP and ORP ( Northoff  et al. , 2010 ). Finally, the external ‘real-world’ validity of the VV-SORP-T for predicting socio-emotional behaviour remains to be established. SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Supplementary data  are available at  SCAN  online.
