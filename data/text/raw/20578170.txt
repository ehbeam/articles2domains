 Chemosensory-based communication is a vital signaling tool in most
species, and evidence has recently emerged in support of the notion that humans
also use social chemosignals (so-called pheromones) to communicate. An ongoing
controversy does exist, however, concerning the receptor organ through which
these chemicals are processed. There is a widespread belief that the vomeronasal
organ (VNO) is responsible for processing social chemosignals in humans. Here we
demonstrate that functional occlusion of the VNO does not change the percept of,
sensitivity toward, or functional neuronal processing of a putative human
pheromone. Perithreshold and suprathreshold perception of the endogenous
chemical androstadienone (AND) were compared, as were positron emission
tomography brain activations evoked by AND when the VNO was either occluded or
left open. In addition, we compared sensitivity to AND in subjects with an
identifiable VNO to those in whom no VNO could be detected. Thus we could
examine the effects of the VNO at several different levels of processing.
Occlusion or absence of the VNO did not affect either the perceptual
measurements or the functional processing of the putative human pheromone, AND.
These results provide strong evidence that the human VNO has no obvious
function. Pheromonal communication in humans may be conveyed via the main
olfactory system.

 INTRODUCTION 
 Chemosensory-based communication has been demonstrated to be a vital
signaling tool in most species studied [ McClintock,
2000 ]. Social signals hidden within the individual’s body odor,
so-called pheromones, communicate such disparate information as kin recognition,
mating compatibility, social status, the presence of danger, and other vital
informational cues [ Johnston, 1998 ;  Lundstrom et al., 2009 ;  Porter et al., 1985 ;  Potts et
al., 1991 ;  Stowe et al., 1995 ]. It
was long assumed that pheromones were processed not in the main olfactory system but
exclusively in a separate accessory system, with the vomeronasal organ (VNO) as a
central receptor organ situated in the nasal cavity [ Meredith, 1991 ;  Wysocki, 1979 ].
Recent studies, however, indicate that the division between the main and accessory
olfactory systems is not as clear as initially believed. The VNO has been
demonstrated to mediate both pheromonal and olfactory signals [ Kelliher, 2007 ;  Sam et al.,
2001 ;  Trinh and Storm, 2003 ], with
similar evidence existing for the main olfactory system [ Boehm et al., 2005 ;  Dorries et
al., 1995 ;  Yoon et al., 2005 ].
Nevertheless, a functional VNO has been demonstrated to be of utmost importance for
many animal and insect species with respect to eliciting appropriate behavior to
conspecifics [ Kimchi et al., 2007 ]. 
 In humans, an anatomically similar structure can typically be found in the
anterior third of the epithelium of the nasal septum [ Jacob et al., 2000 ;  Knecht et
al., 2001 ]. For the sake of brevity, we will refer to the structure as
the VNO. Earlier studies report percentages of human subjects showing a VNO ranging
from 25 to 100%, depending on the technique used to search for it [ Gaafar et al., 1998 ;  Johnson et al., 1985 ;  Knecht et
al., 2001 ;  Moran et al., 1991 ;
 Potiquet, 1891 ;  Stensaas et al., 1991 ;  Trotier
et al., 2000 ;  Won et al., 2000 ].
Moreover, repeated observations on 130 subjects revealed changes in VNO visibility
over time, from nothing visible to well-defined pits and vice versa; in a given
subject, a VNO can be found unilaterally or bilaterally with no obvious predictors
[ Trotier et al., 2000 ]. 
 To date, however, it is not clear whether or not the VNO has a function in
humans—and therefore whether it should be classified as an organ at all. The
human VNO shows properties that are clearly different from the nearby respiratory
epithelium [ Jahnke and Merker, 1998 ;  Witt et al., 2002 ]. This does support a
possible function of the VNO in humans but appears to be best supported in fetuses
[ Bhatnagar and Smith, 2001 ;  Witt et al., 2002 ]. Moreover, stimulating the
VNO with a steroid compound (androstadienone) evoked an electrical response [ Monti-Bloch and Grosser, 1991 ]. However, there
are clear neurochemical and neuroanatomical arguments against a functioning VNO in
humans [ Meisami et al., 1998 ;  Meredith, 2001 ;  Trotier et al., 2000 ;  Witt et al.,
2002 ]. 
 Although in nonhuman animals the VNO to some extent processes common odors,
its main function appears to be processing of social chemosignals. Thus, one might
postulate that if the VNO in humans is a functional organ, the perception and/or the
central processing of chemosignals should be altered when the VNO is occluded. To
date, only one study has investigated the VNO’s role in the perception of a
human endogenous odor.  Knecht et al. [2003] 
measured sensitivity to the odor of androstenone, a steroid found in underarm sweat
[ Gower and Ruparelia, 1993 ], before and
after functionally occluding the VNO by covering its duct with a latex patch.
Functional occlusion of the VNO did not change participants’ perception of
androstenone or that of a nonendogenous control odor. However, androstenone is not
generally considered to be a human chemosignal [ Lundstrom et al., 2006 ]. The endogenous odorant that has been singled
out as the most likely candidate to be a human chemosignal is the closely related
steroid androstadienone (AND). AND is found in axillary secretion [ Nixon et al., 1988 ] and has been reported to
influence women’s mood [ Bensafi et al.,
2004 ;  Jacob and McClintock, 2000 ;
 Lundstrom and Olsson, 2005 ;  Lundstrom et al., 2003a ], psychophysiological
state [ Bensafi et al., 2003 ;  Jacob et al., 2001a ;  Lundstrom and Olsson, 2005 ], regional cerebral blood flow [CBF;
 Gulyas et al., 2004 ;  Jacob et al., 2001b ;  Savic et al., 2001 ,  2005 ], and blood cortisol levels [ Wyart et
al., 2007 ]. Furthermore, cerebral processing of AND has been demonstrated
to be faster than that of comparable common odorants [ Lundstrom et al., 2006 ]. Because of the demonstrated
sex-specific effects in some of these studies [ Jacob
and McClintock, 2000 ;  Savic et al.,
2001 ], AND has been proposed as a human pheromone [ Sobel and Brown, 2001 ]. In a recent report Savic et al.
investigated brain activations after stimulation with AND in anosmic men and healthy
controls. The patients suffered from severe nasal polyposis, which prevented odor
molecules to reach the olfactory cleft, therefore the main olfactory epithelium, and
which rendered patients anosmic. However, the VNO, which is located much more
distally, was not affected. Savic et al. observed typical activations of the
hypothalamus after stimulation with estratetraenol (EST), the female counterpart of
AND; in the control group but not in the patient group [ Savic et al., 2009 ]. They interpreted these results as a proof
that putative human pheromones are perceived via the main olfactory epithelium. 
 The notion of the VNO as a functional organ that processes social
chemosignals in humans is widespread, although there is little evidence to support
it. Here, we report three experiments in which the functional significance of the
human VNO is for the first time explored extensively. In a series of well controlled
experiments we investigated the effect of occluding the VNO either on
women’s perception or on their central processing of a putative human
pheromone. 
 Our specific hypotheses were that if the VNO had a function, (a) functional
occlusion of the VNO should alter the perception of or sensitivity to the endogenous
odorant AND; (b) there should be a difference between subjects with and without a
detectable VNO in their olfactory perception of AND; (c) functional occlusion of the
VNO should change patterns of brain activation after stimulation with AND. 
 
 
 GENERAL MATERIAL AND METHODS 
 The experiments were conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki and
after approval of the local ethics committee. All subjects gave written informed
consent after they were informed in detail about the study. Subjects were asked to
refrain from drinking anything other than water, eating or smoking 1 h before
commencement of testing. They underwent a detailed nasal endoscopy examination prior
to the experiments to exclude nasal obstruction, nasal pathology, and anatomical
features that would have prevented the functional occlusion of the VNO. During the
examination it was determined whether or not a VNO could be detected in either
nostril. If a VNO was detected in both nostrils, the nostril with best accessibility
to the VNO was selected. If a VNO was detected only unilaterally, that nostril was
tested. In the case that no VNO could be detected, a nostril was selected randomly
and the subject was considered as not having a VNO. 
 
 Occlusion of the VNO 
 Functional occlusion of the VNO was achieved using the occlusion
technique described previously [ Knecht et al.,
2003 ]. In short, a latex piece of ~0.5 cm 2  was
placed over the VNO in such a manner that the latex piece would fully cover the
duct of the VNO (“occluded”). This technique has been shown to
effectively block air and chemical access to the VNO [ Knecht et al., 2003 ]. Throughout the different experimental
procedures, the position of the latex patch was repeatedly ascertained by nasal
endoscopy. Experiments 1 and 2 included subjects in whom no apparent VNO could
be detected, and for those subjects the typical position of the VNO on the
mucosa was covered. In all experiments, a spot on the lateral nasal wall was
covered with a similar latex patch (“VNO open”) as a control
measure. The order of which spot (VNO, lateral wall) was covered was randomized
and counterbalanced [ Knecht et al.,
2003 ]. Measures were obtained monorhinally in all experiments, with the
untested nostril occluded by tape (3M, London, ON). 
 
 
 Odorants 
 Identical odorants were used in all three experiments. AND
(androsta-4,16-dien-3-one, Steraloids, Newport, RI) is the most likely candidate
for a human pheromone. AND is a component of human sweat, and its scent is
described as sweaty, algae-like, urinous, and sandalwood-like [ Kraft and Popaj, 2004 ]. As a control, we
used polysantol ®  (CON:
3,3-dimethyl-5-[2,2,3-trimethyl-3-cyclopenten-1-yl]-4-penten-2-ol; Firmenich,
Meyrin, Switzerland). Polysantol is an artificial odorant with sandalwood-like
notes, qualitatively perceived as having a scent similar to that of AND, as
determined in a pilot experiment. Odorants were diluted in propylene glycol
(Sigma Aldrich, Oakville, ON). Starting from pure substances, we mixed stock
solutions of 0.79 g L −1  AND and 6.25% CON. 
 
 
 
 EXPERIMENT 1—SUPRATHRESHOLD ODOR PERCEPTION 
 In Experiment 1, we investigated the effect of occluding the VNO on ratings
of intensity and pleasantness of AND and CON in healthy young women. In addition we
tested whether subjects with a VNO and those in whom no VNO could be detected
differed with respect to these measures. 
 
 Materials and Methods 
 
 Subjects 
 A total of 54 women between 18 and 33 years (mean age 22.9 years)
participated. A VNO was detected in 41 subjects (75%), and in the
remainder no VNO could be detected. After the endoscopic examination, we
occluded either the VNO or the sham location in a randomized counterbalanced
fashion. 
 
 
 Procedure 
 Subjects were asked to rate the intensity and pleasantness of three
concentrations of AND and CON on a visual analog scale [ Aitken, 1969 ]. We used three
concentrations for each odorant (100, 50, and 25% v/v) of the
respective stock solutions. The intensity rating scale ranged from not
perceivable (0) to very strong (100), and the pleasantness scale from very
unpleasant (0) to neutral (50) and very pleasant (100). After the initial
ratings, the position of the cover was changed to the other position (VNO or
lateral wall) and the measurements were repeated. All testing procedures
were performed by a male tester (JF). 
 
 
 Statistical analysis 
 Statistical analyses were applied with the following paradigm.
First, we analyzed the AND ratings of the subjects with and those without a
detectable VNO. We computed two separate repeated measures ANOVAs, one with
AND intensity ratings and the other with AND pleasantness ratings. We
applied a two (VNO: detected, not detected; between subjects) × two
(position: VNO occluded, VNO open; within subjects) × three
(concentration: high, medium, low; within subjects) design. A significant
effect of VNO and/or position and/or an interaction between these two
factors would indicate that the VNO is involved in the perception of
suprathreshold stimuli and thus suggest its functionality. 
 Subjects without a detectable VNO were then excluded from further
analysis. We next analyzed perceptual ratings to determine a potential
impact of the VNO. Two separate repeated measures ANOVAs (one for intensity,
the other for pleasantness) were computed, using a two (position: VNO
occluded, VNO open; within subjects) × two (odor: AND, CON; within
subjects) × three (concentration: high, medium, low; within
subjects) design. Again, a significant effect of position and/or an
interaction position × odor would indicate that the VNO is involved
in the perception of suprathreshold stimuli and thus suggest its
functionality. 
 Finally, we performed planned comparisons based on our a priori
hypothesis in which we had predicted an effect of occlusion of the VNO on
AND ratings. We performed paired  t -tests on the ratings for
the three concentrations of AND between the two positions (VNO occluded, VNO
open). A significant difference in any of these tests would indicate
involvement of the VNO in the perception of suprathreshold concentrations of
AND. Alpha level was set at 0.05 in all analyses. 
 
 
 
 Results 
 In the first analysis, both groups of subjects (with VNO and without
VNO) were included. With regard to intensity ratings, there was an expected
significant effect of concentration ( F  (2,104) = 5.56,
 P  < 0.01), indicating that stronger AND
concentrations rendered higher intensity ratings. However, neither the factor
VNO nor position was significant. There was no other significant main effect or
interaction. With regard to pleasantness ratings, no significant effects were
observed. 
 In the second analysis, subjects without a detectable VNO were excluded.
With regard to intensity ratings, we again observed a significant effect of
concentration ( F  (2,80) = 4.53,  P  <
0.01), indicating that stronger concentrations evoked higher intensity ratings.
In addition, there was a significant effect of odor ( F  (1,40) =
50,  P  < 0.01), indicating that CON was perceived as
more intense than AND. There was no significant effect of VNO occlusion, and
there was no significant interaction between odor and position. With regard to
pleasantness ratings, we observed a significant effect of odor
( F  (1,40) = 4.32,  P  < 0.05),
indicating that CON was perceived as more pleasant than AND. There was no other
significant effect. Importantly, neither the factor position nor an interaction
between odor and position was found to be significant. 
 Since our a priori hypothesis had predicted an effect of VNO occlusion,
we directly compared ratings for the three concentrations of both odorants under
both cover conditions, as a third step. No comparison revealed a significant
difference for the ratings. 
 
 
 
 EXPERIMENT 2—OLFACTORY THRESHOLD 
 In the second experiment we investigated possible effects of occluding the
VNO on detection thresholds of AND and CON. In addition, we tested whether subjects
with a detectable VNO and those in whom no VNO could be detected were different with
respect to these measures. 
 
 Materials and Methods 
 
 Subjects 
 All subjects from Experiment 1 participated; in addition, 20 more
subjects were included, resulting in a total of 74 women between 18 and 35
years (mean age 23.1 years). Endoscopically, a VNO could be detected in 57
women (72%), and no VNO could be observed in 17 (28%). 
 
 
 Procedure 
 We determined olfactory thresholds for AND and CON using an
ascending staircase, three alternative forced choice procedure while
subjects were blindfolded [ Doty,
1991 ]. Threshold was defined as the mean of the last four of seven
staircase reversal points [ Frasnelli et al.,
2002 ]. Immediately prior to the threshold measurements we
occluded either the VNO or a sham location in a randomized counterbalanced
fashion under endoscopic control. So, each subject was tested twice, once
with a covered VNO, once with an open VNO. Sixteen dilutions were prepared
in a geometric series starting from 100% v/v of the previously
mentioned AND stock solution and 12.5% of the CON stock solution
(dilution ratio 1:2) using propylene glycol as solvent. Odors were presented
in 60 mL amber glass bottles containing 10 mL of the stimulus. 
 As in Experiment 1, scores were assessed under two conditions (VNO
occluded vs. open) and all testing procedures were performed by male testers
(JF). 
 
 
 Statistical analysis 
 A total of 31 subjects could not perceive the highest concentration
of AND in one or both of the two threshold assessments for this odorant
(ceiling effect), and could therefore be considered anosmic for AND. No
subject was anosmic to CON. We analyzed the data in three different ways,
from conservative statistics with a large number of subjects to more liberal
statistics with fewer subjects. First, using a chi-square test we compared
the rate of anosmic subjects in both groups (those showing a VNO and those
without a VNO). In a second analysis we included all subjects without
ceiling effects in either of the two conditions or in only one of the two
(e.g., in VNO occluded or in VNO open) for a given odorant. Subjects showing
a ceiling effect were assigned a threshold score of 1. Since this rendered
the dataset nonparametric, we then calculated potential effects of VNO
occlusion (VNO occluded/open) on detection threshold scores for each of the
two odorants using the nonparametric Wilcoxon ranked test. Moreover, we
investigated differences in detection threshold between subjects with versus
those without a detectable VNO using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test.
Third, we included only subjects with a measurable threshold for AND in any
measurement and calculated individual  t -tests; once paired
to compare between the VNO occlusion conditions and once unpaired to compare
between subjects with versus those without a detectable VNO. The alpha level
in all tests was set at 0.05. 
 
 
 
 Results 
 Of the 57 women in whom we detected a VNO, 23 showed a ceiling effect in
both AND threshold assessments (with and without occlusion). Of the 17 women in
whom we did not detect a VNO, 8 showed a ceiling effect in the AND threshold
assessment when the region where a VNO would normally be found was open, and 7
when that region was occluded. There was no significant difference between women
with versus those without a VNO with respect to anosmia rate (chi-square;
 P  = 0.62). This indicates that the incidence of subjects
anosmic to AND is equal in both groups. 
 In the second analysis, we compared results between 33 subjects with VNO
and 11 subjects without a VNO, in whom at least one of two threshold
measurements did not show a ceiling effect for AND. No difference between the
two groups of subjects could be observed (Mann-Whitney;  P 
> 0.35). In addition, within the subjects showing a VNO, no difference
in threshold measurements when the VNO was occluded and when the VNO was left
open could be detected for AND or CON (Wilcoxon:  P  >
0.21). 
 Finally, 35 participants did not show a ceiling effect for AND under
either testing condition (VNO occluded vs. VNO open); in 27 of them a VNO had
been detected, whereas in 8 no VNO could be found. No difference between
subjects with and subjects without a VNO could be observed for any of the four
threshold measurements ( P  > 0.12). In addition, in the
27 subjects with a VNO, no difference could be detected when we compared the
thresholds obtained when the VNO was occluded or left open ( P 
> 0.7). Data are presented in  Figure
1 . 
 
 
 
 EXPERIMENT 3—CEREBRAL ACTIVATION 
 Whereas Experiments 1 and 2 focused on behavioral measures, the aim of
Experiment 3 was to determine whether functional occlusion of the VNO influences
women’s neuronal processing of AND. Specifically, we used PET imaging to
determine brain activations during stimulation with AND and CON while
subjects’ VNO was occluded or a sham location in the nasal cavity was
covered. 
 
 Materials and Methods 
 
 Subjects 
 Twelve women from the previous experiments participated. All
subjects showed a VNO and had a measurable AND threshold. All subjects were
right handed. 
 
 
 Material 
 Subjects where stimulated in the scanner with AND and CON. We used
concentrations of 100 and 25% v/v of the stock solutions,
respectively. As a control, we also presented our subjects with
double-distilled water as an odorless baseline condition. All stimuli were
presented in 60 mL amber glass bottles containing 10 mL of the stimulus. 
 
 
 Procedure 
 On the day before and again just prior to scanning, the presence of
a VNO was ascertained with an endoscope. A nostril in which a VNO had been
detected was chosen for testing and the other nostril was occluded with a
tape (3M, London, ON). We tested six subjects occluding their right nostril
and six subjects with a left nostril occlusion. In half of the scans, the
VNO was occluded by a small piece of latex (VNO occluded). In the other half
we covered a spot on the lateral wall of the nasal cavity for control (VNO
open). Within a single scan we presented one of the two odor stimuli (AND or
CON) or water (baseline) under one of the two occlusion conditions (VNO
occluded or open), for a total of six scan conditions. With the exception of
the baseline, each condition was repeated once for a total of 10 PET scans.
A condition lasted 60 s with a minimum of 10 min between each. 
 Subjects were asked to focus their gaze on a cross mark above their
heads. Before each scan subjects were told whether they would receive an
odor stimulus (i.e., AND or CON) or odorless water (baseline), but they were
not told which odorant they would receive. They were instructed and trained
to breathe normally through the nose during a scan. Stimuli were presented
for 3 s with an interstimulus interval of 5 s, rendering a total of seven
stimulations during a scan (see  Fig. 2 
for an overview of the procedure). During each scan we alternated two
identical sets of stimulation bottles to prevent rarefaction of odor
concentration in the headspace. 
 After each scan, subjects were asked to rate intensity,
pleasantness, and familiarity of each odor using an 11-point visual analog
scale (ranging from 0 to 10). Anchor points were “not
perceivable,” “very unpleasant”, and “very
unfamiliar” for 0, respectively, and “very intense”,
“very pleasant”, and “very familiar” for 10,
respectively. During the experiment, other than the subject, only men were
in the scanner room (JF, JNL, and the PET technician). 
 
 
 PET scanning 
 We used a Siemens Exact HR+ tomograph (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany)
operating in three-dimensional acquisition mode for measuring the
distribution of regional cerebral blood flow (regional CBF). Water labeled
with  15 O served as the tracer. To provide anatomical details,
T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging scans (160 scans, 1 mm)
were obtained with a 1.5T Siemens Sonata Scanner (Siemens, Erlangen,
Germany) for each subject. 
 
 
 Data analysis 
 Preprocessing of the data was done using in-house programs and
following standard conventions [ Worsley et
al., 1992 ;  Zatorre et al.,
1992 ]. In short, we used a 14-mm Hanning filter to reconstruct
regional CBF images, which were subsequently normalized for differences in
global CBF, coregistered with the respective MRI image, and transformed into
the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standardized proportional
stereotaxic space (ICBM305), based on the Talairach and Tournoux atlas. 
 Statistical imaging analyses were done using the in-house program
DOT, following automated procedure [ Collins
et al., 1994 ]. We established the presence of significant changes
in regional CBF initially on the basis of an exploratory search. Here we set
a peak’s  t -value criterion at >4.45 on a
voxel level, corresponding to a corrected  P -value of
<0.05 for a whole brain search volume with ~2,000 resolution
elements or resels. For predicted areas we lowered the criterion to
 t  > 3.0 if the activation was significant at
 P  < 0.05 on a cluster level [ Worsley et al., 1992 ,  1996 ]. 
 In addition, for the directed search within a priori selected
regions known to be involved in the processing of AND and/or common odors,
we defined volumes of interests (VOI). According to earlier reports, we
selected the piriform cortex [PIR;  Zatorre
and Jones-Gotman, 2000 ], medial orbitofrontal cortex [OFC;  Gottfried and Zald, 2005 ], and the
hypothalamus [HYP;  Savic et al.,
2005 ], separately for left or right hemisphere. We placed the VOI in
the right OFC 4-mm lower ( z  = −16) than indicated
in [ Gottfried and Zald, 2005 ] to
locate it in the gray matter, based on the averaged anatomical MRI scan.
Data on coordinates and size of the VOI are presented in  Table I . We extracted normalized
regional CBF values using a 5-mm (7 mm for the mOFC) radius search sphere
and calculated the average response within the VOI for individual subjects
in each condition (stimulus – baseline). We computed repeated
measures ANOVAs with a two (stimulation side: left, right; between subject
factor, since half of the subjects were stimulated on the left nostril and
half on the right nostril) × two (hemisphere: left, right; within
subject factor) × two (odorant: AND, CON; within subject factor)
× two (position: VNO occluded, VNO open; within subject factor)
design. In addition, we performed planned paired  t -tests
between responses when the VNO was occluded or open. 
 Psychophysical data were analyzed by computing repeated-measures
ANOVAs separately for the respective scales, with odor stimulus as a
within-subject factor. 
 
 
 
 Results 
 
 Behavioral data 
 There was no significant difference between odor stimuli in ratings
of intensity or familiarity. Both odors were rated as neutral; CON was rated
as slightly pleasant [5.8 (0.4) of 10 on the VAS] whereas AND was rated as
slightly unpleasant [4.3 (0.3) of 10;  P  = 0.022]. 
 
 
 PET data 
 To determine whether the odors activated cerebral areas known to be
involved in olfactory processing, we compared brain activation after
stimulation with CON and the odorless baseline, independent of the VNO
occlusion, using in the contrast [CON(VNO occ) + CON(VNO open)] −
[baseline(VNO occ) + baseline(VNO open)]. This revealed activations in
traditional olfactory regions, such as the right PIR and the right OFC
( Table II ,  Fig. 3A ). In addition, we observed activations in the
right putamen and the right occipital cortex. Furthermore the contrast
revealed hypothalamic activation. The inverse contrast revealed significant
deactivations after CON stimulation in the left angular gyrus and the right
superior frontal gyrus. 
 The same contrast was computed for AND. Again, we observed
activation of the right occipital pole and the right hypothalamus ( Table II ,  Fig. 3B ). The inverse contrast revealed significant
deactivations after AND stimulation in the bilateral superior frontal gyrus
and the left postcentral gyrus. 
 The two odorants thus did not evoke the same central activation
patterns. When we compared the two odorants directly: [CON(VNO occ) +
CON(VNO open)] − [AND(VNO occ) + AND(VNO open)], we could observe
that CON activated the right OFC and PIR, and thus classical olfactory
regions. The inverse contrast, however, did not reveal any activations
( Table III ,  Fig. 3C ). 
 We then analyzed the contribution of the VNO to the AND-evoked brain
activation, resulting in the contrast AND(VNO open) − AND(VNO occ).
No significant activation was observed. The inverse contrast, however
revealed significant activations in the right inferior temporal gyrus
([ x, y, z ] =55, −44, −20) and an area
below the gyrus rectus, but outside the brain (3, 8, −23). When we
performed the same analysis for the control odor, resulting in the contrast
CON(VNO open) − CON(VNO occ), we observed activation of the right
postcentral gyrus (11, −40, 55; and 13, −40, 60). Again the
inverse contrast revealed significant activations of the right inferior
temporal gyrus (54, −42, −20) and the same area below the
gyrus rectus, but outside the brain (−3, −1, −23).
Since we observed the same peak below the brain (0, 6, −21) when
comparing the two baselines [baseline(VNO occ) −baseline(VNO open)],
we hypothesize this peak to be an artifact resulting from an increased
swelling of the nasal mucosa as a consequence of the placement of the latex
patch on the nasal septum. We controlled for this by performing the contrast
[AND(VNO occ) −AND(VNO open)] − [CON(VNO occ)
−CON(VNO open)]. This contrast reveals the effect of the occlusion
of the VNO on AND-evoked brain activations by eliminating nonspecific
effects due to odor perception or placement of the latex patch. We did not
observe any significant peaks in this contrast. 
 In a second step we performed VOI analysis in regions known to be
involved in the perception of AND and/or common odors. We detected no
significant main effects in the three regions of interest. Specifically,
there was no effect of occluding the VNO. Neither did we observe an
interaction with this factor. 
 We additionally performed planned paired  t -tests
comparing the response in the VOI to both odors, when the VNO was open or
occluded. Again, we did not find any significant difference. Thus,
altogether we found no effect of occlusion of the VNO on brain
activations. 
 
 
 
 
 DISCUSSION 
 In this series of experiments we provide systematic support for the notion
that the human VNO does not have any function in perception and higher processing of
AND or that of a common odorant with similar perceptual characteristics to AND. In
three experiments we found no differences in the outcome when subjects perceived the
odors with the VNO occluded or not. 
 Specifically, in Experiment 1, we showed that occluding the VNO did not
change subjective perception of suprathreshold concentrations of AND and CON in 54
young women. In addition, there were no differences in intensity and pleasantness
ratings between subjects in whom a VNO could be detected and those in whom no VNO
was detectable by means of nasal endoscopy. We could, however, show that stronger
concentrations of the odorants were perceived as stronger; this confirms the
validity of our paradigm. 
 In Experiment 2 we showed that occlusion of the VNO had no effect on odor
detection thresholds of AND and CON in 74 subjects. We analyzed our data by
manipulating the experimental conditions in three different ways. Covering the VNO
did not change threshold in our subjects; furthermore we did not observe any
difference between subjects in whom a VNO could be found and those in whom no VNO
could be detected. Our data are in keeping with the findings of an earlier study in
which the VNO of 19 subjects of both sexes between 16 and 78 years of age was
occluded using the same technique and different odorants [ Knecht et al., 2003 ]. Subjects’ odor detection
thresholds for androstenone and phenylethyl alcohol did not change; in addition they
had the same average threshold as 13 subjects in whom no VNO could be detected. We
show similar results for another endogenous odor in a larger and more homogenous
sample of young women. Taken together, these studies suggest that the VNO in humans
is not involved in the perception of perithreshold concentrations of endogenous
odors (AND and androstenone) or of common odors. 
 Among our 74 subjects, we could determine a reliable threshold in all
measures in only 35. It is known that the sensitivity toward AND varies greatly
within the normal population [ Keller et al.,
2007 ;  Lundstrom et al., 2003b ]. In
addition, we assessed olfactory thresholds in only one nostril. Monorhinally
obtained odor thresholds are known to be significantly higher than birhinal ones
[ Frasnelli et al., 2002 ], indicating that
subjects are more sensitive when they can rely on both nostrils. Therefore, it is
likely that not all subjects demonstrating a ceiling effect are anosmic to AND since
they might have shown a better performance in a birhinal measurement. 
 In Experiment 3, we used PET to measure changes in brain blood flow while
manipulating access to the VNO. Comparisons of both odorants (AND, CON) versus
baseline revealed similar results as in earlier studies. Specifically, we observed
hypothalamic activation when our subjects smelled AND, in agreement with earlier
reports [ Savic et al., 2001 ,  2005 ,  2009 ]. Interestingly, CON, an artificial odorant with (presumably) no
biological effects, but like AND described as having sandalwood-like notes [ Kraft and Popaj, 2004 ], also activated the
hypothalamic area. As a consequence, hypothalamic activation in women following
exposure to AND (and perceptually similar odorants) is probably based on the
association of these odors to male body odor, as suggested by  Savic et al. [2005] , rather than a hard-wired biological
effect. 
 Interestingly, although both odors, AND and CON, were rated as having the
same intensity, AND did not evoke any changes in blood flow in olfactory areas,
whereas CON activated known olfactory areas such as the right posterior
orbitofrontal and piriform cortex. A predominance of the right hemisphere in
olfactory processing has been described earlier [ Zatorre et al., 1992 ]. At first sight, it may seem surprising that AND,
although perceivable, did not activate olfactory regions. However, this is in line
with earlier reports.  Savic et al. [2001 ,
 2005 ,  2009 ] have repeatedly shown that stimulation with AND does not lead to
activation of olfactory regions as common odors do. In addition,  Lundstrom et al. [2008]  showed that body odors,
although evoking a clear olfactory percept, did not activate olfactory regions. In
the latter study the authors found that body odors activate, among other regions,
the right posterior occipital gyrus, in line with our results for both odors. This
occipital activation was not due to visualization, as revealed by additional control
analysis [ Lundstrom et al., 2008 ]. There is
thus converging evidence from imaging and electrophysiological studies [ Lundstrom et al., 2006 ] that AND is processed
differently from common odors. Taken together, the overlap between the results of
our study and those of earlier reports prove the validity of our approach. 
 When we occluded the VNO we did not observe any changes in the brain
activation patterns evoked by AND. This supplies further support for the notion that
the VNO is not involved in the processing and perception of endogenous odors such as
AND and androstenone. In a recent study investigating anosmic men, Savic et al. came
to the same conclusion [ Savic et al., 2009 ].
In their study the authors investigated brain activations after stimulation with
EST, the female counterpart of AND, which in healthy men activated the hypothalamus.
However, in the anosmic group the authors did not observe such activation. These
patients suffered from a severe nasal polyposis, which blocked access to the
olfactory cleft and rendered them anosmic; the VNO, however, which is located much
more anteriorly in the nasal cavity, was unaffected by the polyposis. The authors
therefore concluded that the hypothalamic activation in their healthy subjects was
caused by stimulation of the olfactory epithelium rather than the VNO. Our data
confirm this notion and extend it to women. Taken together, there is now convincing
evidence that the VNO has no function in central olfactory processing or pheromonal
actions of AND and EST. Although the Grueneberg ganglion, an anatomical structure
located at the anterior portion of the nostril, was recently demonstrated to act as
a pheromonal receptor organ for fear odors in rodents [ Brechbuhl et al., 2008 ] and may therefore be a candidate for
having vomeronasal functions in humans; tentative evidence indicates that in humans
the functions of the VNOmight have migrated to the main olfactory system. So, a
vomeronasal receptor gene that in rodents is expressed in the VNO is in humans
expressed in the olfactory mucosa [ Rodriguez et al.,
2000 ]. 
 It may be that the human VNO has a function in fetuses, where nerve
connections exist between the brain and elongated microvillar cells in the VNO
[ Bhatnagar and Smith, 2001 ;  Witt et al., 2002 ]. However, there is now
converging evidence that the VNO in human adults has no apparent function. On a
neurochemical level, it has been shown that the VNO lacks typical markers [ Trotier et al., 2000 ;  Witt et al., 2002 ]. Neuroanatomically, no neuronal connections
are found between the VNO and the brain after week 32 in gestation [ Meisami et al., 1998 ;  Trotier et al., 2000 ;  Witt et
al., 2002 ]. In addition, no accessory bulb or an anatomically equivalent
formation that is required for functional VNO signaling in other animals has been
demonstrated in humans [ Meisami et al., 1998 ;
 Meredith, 2001 ]. In genetic studies, it
has been shown that the gene TRPC2, which is essential for VNO functions in rodents,
is a pseudogene in humans and other primates [ Liman
and Innan, 2003 ]. Furthermore, the  V2R  genes that are
expressed in mammalian VNOs are completely degenerated in primates [ Young and Trask, 2007 ]. Finally, we have
demonstrated that the human VNO has no apparent function in olfactory perception of
a putative pheromone. 
 
 
 CONCLUSION 
 We did not find any support for our hypothesis on a role of the VNO in the
processing of endogenous odorants. Specifically, functional occlusion of the VNO did
not alter the perception of or sensitivity to AND; there was no difference between
subjects with and without a detectable VNO in AND perception; and functional
occlusion of the VNO did not change patterns of brain activation after stimulation
with AND. Thus, our study shows that the human VNO has no function in perception and
processing of the most likely human pheromone and a control odor. Chemosignals in
humans are probably processed via the main olfactory system.

 Figure 1 
 
 Threshold measurements: mean threshold for AND and CON in subjects with
VNO (black bars) and subjects in whom no VNO could be detected (white bars) when
the VNO was left open (open) and when the VNO was covered (occluded). Error bars
indicate standard error of the mean. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 2 
 
 Schematic drawing of the PET procedure: First, under endoscopic control,
the patch was placed either on the VNO (VNO occluded) or on the lateral nasal
wall (VNO open). Then, after injection of H 2 O 15 , subjects
were instructed to sniff for 3 s, during which the odor (CON, AND or, in the
baseline condition, a blank) was presented by holding a bottle under their nose.
Then subjects were instructed to exhale for 5 s, after which the next
stimulation cycle began. The whole stimulation period lasted 60 s. After this,
subjects rated the odors with regard to intensity, pleasantness, and
familiarity. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 3 
 
 Global contrasts: Statistical parametric maps
( t -statistics as represented by the color scale; note that
color scale is inversed in  C ) superimposed on group averaged
anatomical MRI showing group regional CBF response to the processing of
( A ) the control odor (contrast CON–baseline),
( B ) androstadienone (contrast AND–baseline). Figure C
represents the contrast between regional CBF response to CON and AND (contrast
CON– AND). Significant regions are highlighted by colored circles.
