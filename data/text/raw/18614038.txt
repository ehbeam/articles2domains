 Summary 
 Establishing what information is actively maintained in working memory (WM) and how it is represented and controlled is essential to understanding how such information guides future behavior. WM has traditionally been investigated in terms of the maintenance of stimulus-specific information, such as locations or words. More recently, investigators have emphasized the importance of rules that establish relationships between those stimuli and the pending response. The current study used a mental arithmetic task with fMRI to test whether updating of numbers (i.e. stimuli) and updating of mathematical operations (i.e. rules) in WM relies on the same neural system. Results indicate that while a common network is activated by both types of updating, rule updating preferentially activates prefrontal cortex while number updating preferentially activates parietal cortex. The results suggest that both numbers and rules are maintained in WM, but they are different types of information that are controlled independently. 
 
 
 
 
 Introduction 
 Humans rely on many types of rules, such as  stimulus-response  (S-R)  associations  (e.g., red light means stop) and  response contingencies  (e.g., carpool sign means the lane can be used if two or more people are in the car, but not otherwise) (for review see  Bunge, 2004 ). A rule may be generally defined as an  if-then  function that establishes a relationship between one event and another event, where such events and relationships are broadly defined. An event could be a specific stimulus or response (e.g., if red traffic light, then depress brake pedal), or a more abstract cognitive operation or state (e.g., if you see a new person at your workplace, say hello and introduce yourself). Rules can be learned either explicitly, as in arbitrary symbols such as road signs that are associated with specific meanings, or implicitly learned, as in unspoken rules for social interaction (e.g.,  Meyer & Kieras, 1997a , for review see  Bunge, 2004 ). 
 Traditionally, working memory has been investigated in terms of the maintenance and control of stimulus-specific features, such as in the Multiple Component Model ( Baddeley & Logie, 1999 ) of working memory (WM), which included the phonological loop and visuospatial sketchpad for the maintenance of verbal and visual information, respectively ( Baddeley & Hitch, 1974 ). However, other types of information, such as rules, appear to also be maintained and controlled in an active state to guide behavior, particularly when task rules are changing rapidly or the current rule requires that one over-ride a prepotent response ( Miller & Cohen, 2001 ). Several researchers have shown that cells in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are active while a rule is maintained (e.g.,  Sakai and Passingham, 2003 ;  Bunge et al., 2003 ;  Braver et al., 2003 ). Rule-selective cells and stimulus-selective cells appear to co-exist within the same regions of the PFC ( Wallis et al., 2001 ;  Watanabe, 1986 ;  White & Wise, 1999 ;  Fuster, 2001 ), suggesting that rule and stimulus information may be different dimensions of the same type of information with both information dimensions actively maintained in WM by the same neural system. 
 One difficulty in studying rules is that rules typically contain stimulus information as a part of the rule, such as the particular words, objects, locations, type of stimulus, stimulus features, or stimulus relationships that are task relevant. For example, a recent fMRI study on rule retrieval and maintenance used rules consisting of stimulus-response associations (e.g., press the left button in response to a flower) ( Crone et al., 2006 ). Anterior regions of the PFC have been shown to be active during rule maintenance, without differential modulation of activation magnitude according to the stimulus information domain ( Sakai and Passingham, 2003 ,  2006 ). These regions appear to differentially interact with stimulus information-domain-specific areas, presumably in preparation for preferentially processing that information according to the current rule ( Sakai and Passingham, 2006 ). It is not clear how rules that do not involve preferential processing of one type of stimulus information over another are represented and implemented, or whether the rule information is maintained independently of the stimulus information. 
 This intimate relationship between rule and stimulus information has also made it difficult to interpret the results of studies that involved updating of information in working memory. For instance, in a recent fMRI study investigating updating of object identity information in working memory, task rules transiently changed at the time of each stimulus update because the cue told the subject that they should temporarily stop making delayed match-to-sample decisions and instead drop the previous sample stimulus from working memory and encode the next item as the new sample ( Roth et al., 2006 ). This study found transient activity at the time of working memory updates in a frontoparietal network that was similar to the network found in previous studies that explicitly involved rule updating (for review see  Brass & von Cramon, 2004 ). Similar patterns of activation have been observed in studies of task switching, which typically involve simultaneous updates of rules and perceptual stimulus processing demands ( Dosenbach et al., 2006 ,  Slagter et al., 2006 ). The current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study sought to elucidate whether the frontoparietal network found in previous updating studies is involved in any type of change in working memory, or whether there might be dissociable neural systems for updating rules versus stimuli in WM. 
 In the current study, participants performed a mental arithmetic task in which they independently updated rules and numbers held in WM. See  Figure 1 . Before starting the experiment, participants memorized the numbers 47 and 53, and the operations (rules) add (ADD) and subtract (SUB). These numbers and operations were used as the stimulus-specific and rule information that were being held and updated in WM. Only one of these two numbers and one of these two rules were relevant for a given trial. At the beginning of each trial, the participant was given a cue to update either the number, rule, or both, or they were given a hold cue indicating that they were to maintain the same information. Following a delay after the cue, participants received a second number and performed mental arithmetic using that number and the currently relevant number and rule held in WM. A frontoparietal network of regions showed transient increases in activation for all update events compared to hold events. Certain regions showed differential modulation in a direct contrast of rule update compared to stimulus update events: the left inferior frontal junction (IFJ) exhibited greater activation for rule updates, whereas bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS) showed greater activation for stimulus updates. These information-type effects were found only during the cue period, at the time of updating working memory, not at the time of implementing the new rule during the calculation. These results indicate that both rules and stimuli are maintained in working memory and are controlled by a common frontoparietal network. In addition, the results show that different parts of this network are differentially involved in rule updates versus stimulus updates, providing initial evidence that the representation of rules in working memory is dissociable from the representation of the stimuli and responses to which those rules apply. 
 
 
 Results 
 
 Behavioral results 
 Reaction times (RT) and accuracy rates for the answer screen, which was presented following the presentation of the second number to be used for the calculation (see  Experimental Procedures  for trial progression), were measured as the dependent variables. Participants were instructed to emphasize both speed and accuracy in their responses. Only correct trials were included in the RT analysis. The results are shown in  Figure 2 . In a within-subject ANOVA for reaction time, there was no significant effect of trial type (RT = 848.526 ± 21.73ms for HOLD, 884.108 ± 26.78ms for NMBR, 883.425 ± 31.05ms for RULE, 856.463 ± 22.03ms for BOTH; F (3,15)  = 1.354, p = 0.097, with a Geisser-Greenhouse correction). The ANOVA with accuracy as a dependent variable revealed a significant effect of trial type (0.754 ± 0.025 for HOLD, 0.768 ± 0.023 for NMBR, 0.730 ± 0.025 for RULE, 0.723 ± 0.026 for BOTH; F (3,15)  = 3.983, p = 0.020, with a Geisser-Greenhouse correction). Participants exhibited somewhat high overall errors in the task, which can be attributed to the general difficulty of continuous mental arithmetic and the requirement of updating of relevant information in working memory. Tukey's HSD was used to compare accuracy means according to trial type using the 95 percent confidence interval (p<0.05) in all tests of confidence. We found a significant difference between NMBR updates (0.768 ± 0.023) compared to BOTH updates (.723 ± 0.026). However, importantly, there was no significant difference for reaction time or accuracy, in the primary comparison of interest, rule update versus number update. There was also no significant difference between any of the update conditions and the hold condition. The lack of difference in performance suggests that fMRI activation differences do not result from different difficulty levels of the rule and number updates. 
 There was also no significant difference in behavioral performance for addition versus subtraction trials (RT = 753.894 ± 33.41ms for ADDITION, 782.586 ± 30.24ms for SUBTRACTION; t(15) = -1.359, p = 0.194) (Accuracy = 0.745 ± 0.039 for ADDITION, 0.747 ± 0.040 for SUBTRACTION; t(15) = -0.184, p = 0.856). 
 
 
 Update-related fMRI Activity 
 
 Identification of Regions Involved in Updating 
 Only trials where subjects correctly updated or maintained information according to trial cues were used in the analysis of fMRI data. The primary question of interest was whether there might be dissociable systems for updating rules versus stimuli in WM. To assess this question, we first identified regions that showed greater activity for update (NMBR, RULE, BOTH) versus hold events. Areas that showed greater activation for all update types versus hold ( Fig. 3 ) included left and right intraparietal sulcus (IPS), superior parietal lobule (SPL), left inferior frontal junction (IFJ), left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and presupplementary motor area (preSMA). For a list of all active areas, see  Supplementary Table 1  online. This set of regions appears identical to the frontoparietal network of regions identified in previous studies of rule switching and working memory updating (e.g.,  Brass & von Cramon, 2004 ;  Roth et al., 2006 ;  Crone et al., 2006 ), so it appears to be a general updating network regardless of the particular stimuli and rules used. 
 
 
 Regions Showing Interaction of Condition and Event 
 Of particular interest was whether there existed differences within this frontoparietal update-network among the different update conditions during the  cue  period, which is when the rule (RULE) or number (NMBR) or both the rule and number (BOTH) must be updated and then maintained in a preparatory state, before the presentation of the calculation screen allowed subjects to implement the rule. Thus, within the set of regions active for the contrast of update versus hold events, we identified areas that showed a significant interaction of condition (NMBR, RULE, BOTH) by event (cue, calculation, answer). These areas included bilateral IPS, precentral sulcus, and left IFG. Areas showing a main effect of condition included bilateral IPS, bilateral SPL, cingulate gyrus, and medial superior frontal gyrus (SFG). Areas showing a main effect of event included bilateral IPS, SPL, preSMA, MFG, and SFG. For a list of all active areas, see  Supplementary Table 2  online. 
 
 
 Rule versus Number Updating: Direct Contrast of Activity 
 In order to further test whether these interaction effects specifically reflected the hypothesized difference between RULE and NMBR updates during the cue period, areas that showed significant activity for all update types versus hold were also used as a mask to assess specific differences between conditions, separately during different events of the trial. A direct contrast of RULE versus NMBR updates during the  cue  period revealed greater activation in the left IFJ for RULE updates, and greater activation in the bilateral IPS and preSMA for NMBR updates ( Fig. 4 ). The IFJ is located near the junction of the inferior frontal sulcus and the precentral sulcus. Importantly, a direct contrast of RULE versus NMBR updates during the  calculation  period revealed  no  significantly activated clusters. 
 These results indicate that differential rule versus number update activity was related to the update and maintenance of the number and/or rule in working memory and not to the implementation of that information during the calculation, as can be seen in  Fig. 4  where the estimated percent signal change for each condition during each task period is shown. Mean beta weights for the three update conditions (NMBR, RULE, BOTH), scaled to percent signal change, were extracted for each participant and plotted for each event in the trial (cue, calculation, answer) for the regions that demonstrated a difference in activation for RULE versus NMBR. Percent signal change plots ( Fig. 4 ) confirm that number and rule update activity differences take place during the  cue  period, not during the  calculation  or  answer  period. These plots also show that activity is not additive in these regions when updating both the number and rule compared to updating only the number or rule, suggesting that each of these areas is primarily involved either with updating only number or with updating rule information, not both types of information. 
 
 
 Both versus Rule or Number Updates: Direct Contrast of Activity 
 To further investigate the possibility of additive effects of updating both number and rule simultaneously, direct contrasts of BOTH versus NMBR updates and BOTH versus RULE updates were performed within the set of regions generally active for all updates versus HOLD. The direct contrast of BOTH versus RULE during the  cue  period showed significantly greater activity for the BOTH condition in several regions, including bilateral IPS, left MFG, and left IFG. For a list of all active areas, see  Supplementary Table 3  online. The regions of parietal cortex showing greater activation for BOTH compared to RULE updates mostly overlapped with those showing greater activation for NMBR versus RULE updates, as would be expected if parietal cortex were primarily involved in number updates rather than rule updates, because the BOTH condition also contains a number update. However, BOTH was not significantly greater than NMBR in these areas, indicating no additive effect. Several regions were more active for BOTH than NMBR, including left IFG, right superior parietal lobule (SPL), and preSMA. The preSMA region found active in the contrast of BOTH greater than NMBR was anterior to the preSMA area observed in the contrast of NMBR greater than RULE. The MFG and IFG activations for BOTH versus RULE and the IFG activations for the BOTH versus NMBR analysis were also somewhat different from each other. However,  neither  the MFG and IFG activations for BOTH greater than RULE  nor  the IFG activations for BOTH greater than NMBR overlapped with the regions for RULE greater than NMBR. More specifically, the left IFG regions found active for the contrasts of BOTH greater than NMBR and BOTH greater than RULE were located more inferiorly than the left IFJ activation observed for RULE greater than NMBR. Taken together, these results indicate that the intraparietal sulcus is primarily involved with updating stimulus information, while the IFJ is primarily involved with updating rule information. On the other hand, the SPL and subregions of the inferior and middle frontal gyri inferior to the IFJ appear to be more generally involved in both rule and stimulus updates. 
 
 
 
 
 Discussion 
 In summary, we found a frontoparietal network of regions involved in updating both rules and numbers in working memory. These regions showed activation for both RULE updates and NMBR updates relative to HOLD events. This network appears to be identical to the network previously found in other studies of rule switching and working memory updating using different stimuli and tasks (e.g.,  Brass & von Cramon, 2004 ;  Roth et al., 2006 ;  Crone et al., 2006 ), so it appears to be a general updating network, regardless of the particular stimuli and rules used. The existence of a single network of regions involved in controlling the contents of working memory for both rule and number information provides evidence that both stimulus-specific information and rule information may be maintained in an active state and controlled via similar neural systems. Task set, or “rule”, maintenance has often been treated in the literature as part of the “central executive”, and thus qualitatively different from maintenance of stimulus information via the phonological loop and the visuospatial sketch pad ( Baddeley, 1996 ;  Smith & Jonides, 1999 ). Our results suggest instead that task sets and stimulus information in WM might be controlled by qualitatively similar neural mechanisms. 
 Within this network of regions, we also found areas that showed differential modulation depending on whether there was a rule versus a stimulus update: the IFJ showed greater update-related activity for rules and the IPS showed greater update-related activity for stimuli. There were no areas of parietal cortex that showed greater activation for rule than stimulus updates and there were no areas of lateral frontal cortex that showed greater activation for stimulus than rule updates. 
 There were other regions in both parietal and frontal cortex that appeared to respond generally to any type of update. The regions of parietal cortex showing greater activation for BOTH than RULE updates, which were in the intraparietal sulcus, mostly overlapped with those showing greater activation for NMBR than RULE updates, indicating that the IPS is primarily involved with updating stimulus information. A region in the SPL, on the other hand, demonstrated greater activation for BOTH than NMBR, but not RULE than NMBR, or NMBR than RULE, indicating that this region of parietal cortex may be involved in updating both rules and numbers. In inferior frontal cortex, there were also selective and general subregions, but the selective regions were rule-selective rather than number-selective. In inferior frontal cortex, there was a lack of overlap between the RULE>NMBR region of activation and both the BOTH>RULE and BOTH>NMBR regions of activation. Areas showing general update-related activity were located more inferiorly than those showing rule-selective activity. These results are generally consistent with single cell data indicating that ventrolateral cortex has a mix of object and rule selective cells while dorsolateral PFC has a greater percentage of rule-selective cells ( Wallis et al., 2001 ), although in the current results the rule-selective and general-update subregions are both within ventrolateral human PFC and reflect transient update activity rather than maintenance activity. 
 Taken together, these results indicate that rules are maintained in WM and that the components of the neural system involved in updating rule and stimulus information in WM are functionally dissociable. The preferential involvement of the prefrontal cortex in rule updating and parietal cortex in stimulus updating may be interpreted as supporting the Baddeley model qualitative distinction between rule representation as a part of the central executive and stimulus representation as part of the slave systems. Alternatively, the results may argue for the existence of an additional “slave system” for rule information maintenance, with both rules and stimuli in WM controlled by common “executive” mechanisms. Rules may be maintained through intra-prefrontal circuits while stimulus information is maintained by circuits that involve interactions between posterior prefrontal regions and secondary sensory areas such as parietal cortex ( Goldman-Rakic, 1995 ;  Fuster 2001 ). 
 For the purpose of specificity in the remainder of the discussion, stimulus information will be referred to as number information. 
 
 Different Dimensions of an Integrated Representation or Distinct Information Types? 
 The finding of differential modulation in IFJ and IPS for rule versus number updates also provides initial evidence for dissociable  representations  for rule and number information in WM. If we had found a single mechanism for updating both rule and number information, this would not have definitively answered whether rules can be represented in WM via different cell populations from the stimuli to which the rules are applied, since a single control mechanism could update both types of information. Such a result was obtained in a study of updating faces and houses in WM, which showed differences in the sustained activity related to maintaining the identities of these two different object types in WM ( Roth et al., 2006 ; see also  Sala et al., 2003 ), but there was no activation difference between updating houses versus updating faces. However, results of the current study showing differences in update-related activation for rules compared to numbers provides evidence for dissociable WM representations. If the representation of rules was completely integrated with the representations of stimuli, such as if the participants had maintained one of four equivalent rule-number combinations in WM (ADD-47, SUB-47, ADD-53, SUB-53), potentially via the phonological loop, then updating from ADD-47 to SUB-47 would be equivalent to updating from ADD-47 to ADD-53. One would not expect to see differential activations for updating one set of integrated representations versus another. 
 Previous single cell recording studies suggested that PFC contains some cells that are selective for stimulus properties, some that are selective for the response rule, and others that have dual selectivity ( Wallis et al., 2001 ;  Genovesio et al., 2005 ). While such a result could be interpreted as demonstrating separate cell populations and thus separate neural representations, such studies did not provide evidence for separate cortical regions or neural systems as these cell types were found intermingled within the same PFC region. Thus, previous results could have also resulted from an integrated representation. Analogously, cells in inferior temporal cortex could be (erroneously) classified as “orientation-selective”, “curvature-selective”, “position-selective”, or some combination of these if only a few exemplar stimulus properties were used. However, sophisticated analysis using a wide range of stimulus dimensions has demonstrated that cells in inferotemporal cortex use a neural population code to represent object shape by integrating all of these stimulus dimensions ( Brincat and Connor, 2004 ). The suggestion from the results of the current study of dissociable representations of rule and number information does not necessarily imply independence of representations, just as object features and object locations are not independent representations but are dissociable, both behaviorally and neurally. Rather, the results of the current study suggest that the representations of rule and number information in working memory do not simply reflect different semantic dimensions of a single neuronal population code, but instead are treated as different types of information by this working memory control system. 
 
 
 Transient Activity: Update Control or Resulting Change in Representation? 
 One remaining question based upon the present evidence is whether the observed differences in activation during updating numbers and rules reflect regions that are involved in the representation of the different types of information themselves or the updating control mechanisms. It is possible that rules and numbers are maintained separately in these respective areas and the transient activity in the IFJ region reflects a change in the representation of rule information while the transient activity in the IPS region reflects a change in the representation of number information. Alternatively, rule and number information may be represented elsewhere, but the control mechanisms (e.g., priority maps) for both types of information are located in the respective brain regions transiently activated in the current study. Several lines of evidence provide support for both possibilities. 
 In terms of the activity differences reflecting regions involved in representing rule or number information, parietal activation is consistently found in number processing tasks ( Chochon et al., 1999 ;  Pinel et al., 1999 , but see  Shuman and Kanwisher, 2004 ). The horizontal IPS has been suggested to subserve the core quantity system, analogous to an ‘internal number line’ supplemented by two separate systems, one of which is the bilateral posterior superior parietal lobes for attentional functions similar to attentional orienting in space, i.e., shifting attention along an internal number line is similar to shifting attention in space ( Dehaene et al., 2003 ;  Knops et al., 2006 ). A recent fMRI study provided evidence for distinct neuronal populations for numbers, with numerical representations that are notation dependent in the right parietal lobe, thus nonabstractly represented, and an abstract representation of quantities in left parietal lobe ( Kadosh et al., 2007 ). Thus, in regard to number updating in this study, it could be the case that the numbers being updated are represented in IPS regions and transient updating activity reflects the changing representation of information in IPS. 
 Similarly, several lines of evidence suggest that rule information is represented in PFC regions. Studies using both single cell recording in monkeys and fMRI in humans have shown neuronal activity in PFC regions during rule maintenance ( Wallis & Miller, 2001 ;  Bunge et al., 2003 ;  Sakai and Passingham, 2003 ). It is thought that this sustained activity is related to the representation of the rule information. In addition, delay-period, maintenance-related activations in the PFC that are clearly domain-specific (e.g.,  Courtney et al., 1998 ;  Wilson et al., 1993 ) or even stimulus specific (e.g.,  Fuster & Alexander, 1971 ;  Kojima & Goldman-Rakic, 1982 ) could be interpreted as representing “rules” rather than simply the stimuli themselves (e.g. “If this face is presented during the test, press the right button”). Taken together, these previous results suggest that the transient activity differences observed in the IFJ and IPS regions in the current study could reflect changes in the representation of information, with the IFJ involved in the representation of rule information and IPS representing number or stimulus information. 
 Alternatively, our results could reflect neural mechanisms responsible for updating or controlling rule and stimulus information, with the neural representation of the rule and stimulus information elsewhere in the cortex. Results of several studies (e.g.  Brass and von Cramon, 2004 ,  Roth et al., 2006 ,  Crone et al., 2006 ;  Dosenbach et al., 2006 ;  Corbetta et al., 2005 ) suggest that regions similar to those identified in the current study, such as the IPS, preSMA, and the IFJ, are more involved in updating and control of information than representation of the information itself. 
 Other studies showed updating activation overlapping with maintenance activation ( Roth et al., 2006 ;  Crone et al., 2006 ). These studies indicate that, within regions active for the WM maintenance of verbal and visual information, there is a subset of regions that are also active for WM updating. In the current study it is likely that there were additional regions, such as the posterior inferior frontal gyrus and anterior insula (near Broca's area, for verbal rehearsal of information) that were involved in the sustained maintenance of rules and numbers, but they were not additionally, transiently activated for updating either rules or numbers. It remains to be shown whether the regions active in the current study are involved in the representation, updating, or both the representation and updating of rule and stimulus information. 
 
 
 Summary 
 Taken together, these results indicate that rules are maintained in WM and that the neural systems involved in updating rules and numbers in WM are dissociable. These results further suggest that the WM representation of rules is dissociable from the WM representation of numbers. These results support ideas of both “domain specificity” and “cognitive control” in working memory proposing that multiple types of information (including verbal, visuospatial, and task rules) are represented in working memory through sustained patterns of neural activity in dissociable cell populations. Each of these sustained activity patterns may then exert “control” by biasing competitive interactions in other brain areas, including those representing other types of information in working memory such as the working memory representation of the rule that verbal rather than spatial information is relevant influencing the amount and selectivity of activation in dorsal and ventral posterior prefrontal cortex ( Courtney et al., 2007 ). In this view, the “central executive” may not be qualitatively different from the “slave systems”: both involve selective sustained representation of task relevant information and both influence the representation of other types of information through interactions among brain areas. Thus, by applying what is known regarding the neural mechanisms of biased competition in perceptual attentional selection and the neural mechanisms of the phonological loop and the visuospatial sketch pad to understanding the representation and control of rule information, understanding the neural mechanisms of higher cognition may become more tractable. 
 
 
 
 Experimental Procedures 
 
 Participants 
 Participants were 16 adults (6 males, 19-34 years) who were non-smokers in good health that had no history of head injury, neurological, or mental disorders, drug or alcohol abuse, and no current use of medications that affect central nervous system or cardiovascular function. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Johns Hopkins University and the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions. Participants were compensated with $50 for the scanner session and $10 for the practice session. All subjects gave written informed consent. 
 
 
 Stimuli 
 Stimuli ( Fig. 1 ) included a reminder screen with the numbers 47 and 53 and the rules ADD and SUB (subtract) positioned centrally on the screen, and each reminder screen had one number and one rule highlighted in red. Four cue screen types indicated the update instruction: HOLD, NMBR, RULE, or BOTH, each of which was positioned foveally. The ISI consisted of an empty box presented in the center of the screen, and the calculation screen consisted of a single number presented in the box in the center of the screen. The answer screen consisted of four boxes that each contained a different number. Stimuli were presented and behavioral data was collected on a Power Macintosh G4 desktop computer running SuperLab Pro software. An LCD projector located outside of the scanning room back-projected the stimuli onto a screen located inside the bore of the scanner. Subjects viewed the stimuli via a mirror mounted to the top of the head coil. Responses were made with a handheld 4-choice response button box that was connected via fiber optic cable to a Cedrus RB-610 Response Box. 
 
 
 Procedure 
 All participants were given written and verbal instructions and completed a 60-minute practice version of the task, no less than 24 hours before the scanning session, so as to minimize initial learning effects in the scanner. Subjects performed a series of mental arithmetic calculations using currently relevant items held in working memory. Before starting the experiment, subjects were instructed to memorize the numbers 47 and 53, and the operations ADD and SUB (subtract). The two numbers and two operations were used as the stimulus-specific and abstract rule information, respectively, that were being updated in working memory. This allowed for random switching among a total of four items in working memory, with two items (one number and one rule) having higher attentional priority for use on each trial. It is possible that the two items not being used on the current trial were not being actively maintained in working memory, and instead were retrieved from long-term memory when there was an instruction to update, but WM would be updated in both cases –either through a change in the relative priority of two items being actively maintained or through replacement of one item with its paired associate through long-term memory retrieval. Addition and subtraction were selected as the rule information being updated since a rule was needed that could be maintained or changed independently of whether the stimulus set changed; thus, the rule is abstract ( Passingham and Sakai, 2004 ). 
 An example trial is illustrated in  Figure 1 . Before the start of the run, subjects were presented a reminder screen for 2s to indicate which number and rule was active at the start of the run. The reminder screen had both numbers and both rules that were previously memorized, with one number and rule highlighted in red. The reminder screen appeared once every 7, 11, or 15 trials. This reminder screen allowed subjects to make correct calculations for the subsequent trails in the case that they lost track of which number and rule were currently relevant. Subjects were instructed to stop responding if they forgot which number and rule were relevant. The trial progression was as follows: 
 
 
 A 1s cue screen indicated whether the subject was to update (switch) or hold the items that were currently being maintained. The four possible cues presented were HOLD, NMBR, RULE, BOTH. The HOLD cue indicated that the subject must continue to hold the same number and rule in working memory that was highlighted on the reminder screen or that was relevant for the preceding trial. A NMBR cue instructed the subject to change the currently relevant number to the alternate, while keeping the rule the same. A RULE cue instructed to change the currently relevant rule to the alternate, while keeping the number the same. A BOTH cue indicated to change both the number and rule. Following the cue the subject had to maintain the relevant information regarding the number and the rule in a preparatory state but could not implement the rule until the presentation of the calculation screen. The proportions of each cue type were 40% HOLD, 20% NMBR, 20% RULE, and 20% BOTH. 
 
 
 A calculation event consisted of the presentation of a single number, which subjects were instructed to either add to or subtract from the number held in working memory, according to the rule currently in use. This number was presented within a box after a jittered inter-stimulus interval (ISI) duration of 2, 4, or 6s. The number of occurrences of each of the jitter lengths was nearly identical across all conditions. The number presented during the calculation screen ranged from 14 to 37, in order to restrict the range of correct answers from 10 to 90. This calculation screen remained on for 4s, during which the subject was to perform the calculation. 
 
 
 An answer event consisted of the presentation of the four answer choices, during which subjects were required to make a button press response to indicate which of the numbers was the correct answer to the calculation. This screen remained on for 2.5s, during which the subject made a response. 
 
 
 Following the response to the answer screen, steps 2 and 3 were repeated (i.e. an additional calculation was made using the same number and rule as the previous calculation in the trial, but with a new second number). Two calculations were thus made on each trial in order to facilitate a steady “holding state” for the HOLD trials. Due to the continuous switching over the course of trials, it is likely that HOLD trials would not reflect activity associated with holding items in memory if there were only one calculation. Having two calculations for each trial allowed the subject to use the same number and rule over an extended period of time, which was important to facilitate holding state activity, rather than switch-related activity, during the HOLD trials. 
 
 
 In the response screen, the three alternate (incorrect) choices could consist of either: (1) the answer corresponding to the alternate number, (2) the answer corresponding to the alternate rule, (3) the answer corresponding to the alternate number and rule, or (4) a foil that is either ±2 or ± 10 away from the actual answer. The alternate answer choices that correspond to the alternate number, rule, or both number and rule were included to discourage the subject from inferring the number and rule currently in use from the answers, rather than updating the information at the time of the cue. The foil number that was either ±2 away from the actual answer was used as a distractor that was near the actual answer, and this foil type comprises 1/2 of the foil numbers. The other foil type that comprised the other 1/2 of the foils is +/- 10 from the actual answer was used to discourage subjects from utilizing a strategy where only the ones place value was calculated, rather than calculating through the tens place. The 3 alternate choices from this set of 4 were randomly selected for use in the answer screen, along with the correct answer choice. 
 
 
 fMRI Data Acquisition 
 All scans were carried out on a 3 T Philips Gyroscan at the F.M. Kirby Research Center for Functional Brain Imaging at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, MD. Anatomical scans were acquired with a SENSE (MRI Devices, Inc., Waukesha, WI) parallel-imaging head coil using a magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) T 1  weighted sequence (200 axial slices, 1 mm thickness, TR = 8.2 ms, TE = 3.7 ms, flip angle = 8°, matrix 256 × 256, FOV 256 mm). During the performance of the cognitive tasks, functional T 2 * weighted, echo planar images (27 axial slices, 3 mm thickness, 1 mm gap, TR = 1500 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 65°, matrix 80 × 80, FOV 240 mm) were collected. All scans were acquired in the axial plane and aligned parallel to the line from the anterior commissure to the posterior commissure. 
 
 
 Data Analysis 
 
 Behavioral Analysis 
 Data from reaction time and error rates were analyzed separately. A within-subject analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to test for differences between WM conditions. Geisser-Greenhouse corrected P values are reported. Error trials were determined based upon the type of error made. As mentioned in  Experimental Procedures: Procedure , the incorrect answer choices were selected from a set of relevant numbers. Based upon the design of the experiment, participants who failed to update the rule, number, or both when given an update cue would answer incorrectly for the given trial and all trials following it, until they stopped responding or the reminder screen appeared to indicate the relevant number and rule in use. Thus, due to the failure to update, an error on a single trial produced errors on all subsequent trials until a reminder screen was presented. For example, it was possible that participants missed a single update (i.e., RULE update), and therefore used the incorrect rule on the given trial and subsequent trials, responding to the answer corresponding to the alternate rule. If, on subsequent trials, subjects continued updating correctly, it could be deduced that subjects were updating correctly and answering correctly, even though the response was incorrect. For trials that showed a pattern of responses wherein the number or rule was updated and calculated correctly, but answered incorrectly due to the previous failure to update, we could conclude that the responses on these trials were not errors attributable to the failure to update or calculate correctly. Thus, those trials were used in the fMRI analysis. 
 
 
 Voxelwise General Linear Model 
 Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI) software was used for data analysis. Functional echo planar imaging data were phase-shifted using Fourier transformation to correct for slice acquisition time, and motion-corrected using 3D volume registration. Multiple regression analysis was performed on the time series data at each voxel, for all voxels in the brain volume. There were separate event-related regressors for each of the following: cue, calculation, and answer events for hold, number, rule, and both trials, and error trials. Regressors were convolved with a gamma function model of the hemodynamic response which included the 10 s following events (delay time of 2 s, rise time of 3 s, and a fall time of 5 s). The unmodeled time points corresponding to the ISI, 2 nd  calculation screen, 2 nd  answer period, and ITI defined the baseline. Mixed effects analyses, with subjects as a random factor, were performed on the imaging data. Individual participant data were spatially smoothed using a smoothing kernel of 4 mm. The high resolution anatomical image was registered to the echo planar imaging data, and then transformed into the Talairach coordinate system. 
 General linear contrasts were performed on the regression coefficients to assess a main effect of update (NMBR, RULE, BOTH) versus HOLD. Within the set of regions that showed significant activity for all update types versus HOLD, another set of general linear contrasts were performed to identify areas that showed a significant interaction of condition (NMBR, RULE, BOTH) by event (cue, calculation, answer). We also tested for specific differences (e.g., RULE > NMBR during cue period) among update conditions during different events of the trial. To further investigate activity within regions identified by RULE versus NMBR direct contrasts, mean beta weights for the three update conditions (NMBR, RULE, BOTH), scaled to percent signal change, were extracted for each participant and plotted for each event in the trial (cue, calculation, answer). 
 Tests of voxel-wise significance for whole-brain analysis were held to  p  < 0.05 (t-threshold of 2.13) and corrected for multiple comparisons via spatial extent of activation, holding each cluster of voxels to an experiment-wise  P  < 0.05. Based upon a Monte Carlo simulation with 1000 iterations run via the AFNI software package, using a smoothing kernel of 4mm on the union of all subject's brain volumes (as classified using the EPI signal intensity threshold), it was estimated that a 942 μL contiguous volume (67 voxels, each measuring 1.875 × 1.875 × 4mm) satisfied the  p  <0.05 threshold. Tests of voxel-wise significance run within the set of frontoparietal regions activated in the contrast of all update greater than hold were held to  p  < 0.01 (t-threshold of 3.65), and it was estimated that a 492 μL contiguous volume (35 voxels, each measuring 1.875 × 1.875 × 4mm) satisfied the  P  <0.01 threshold.

 Example Trial Event Progression 
 In this example, the reminder screen indicates that 47 and ADD are the number and rule that will be used for the upcoming trial. This reminder screen only appeared every 7, 11, or 15 trials. At the beginning of each trial a cue appears, instructing the subject to continue to (in this case) hold the same number and rule (47 ADD). A screen with a blank box appears (ISI), which the subject is told to fixate, and a number appears in this box 2, 4, or 6 seconds later. In this case, the number in the box is 11, so the subject must start performing the calculation 47+11 = N. An answer screen then appears with four numbers, and the subject should make a button response indicating that 58 is the correct answer. Another calculation screen follows this and the subject must perform a second calculation using the same number and rule, 47+15 = N. The subject must again choose the correct answer. After this trial is complete, the subject will still be maintaining 47 and ADD, which may change for the following trial, depending on the cue presented next.

 Regions Showing Activity for Interaction of Condition and Event, and Direct Contrast of Rule and Number Updates During Cue Period 
 All regions were masked to include only activity in those regions that also demonstrated greater activity for update events than hold ( Figure 3 ). Purple activity reflects areas showing interaction of condition (NMBR, RULE, BOTH) by event (cue, calculation, answer), red activity reflects direct contrast of RULE > NMBR updates overlapping with interaction activity, dark blue activity reflects direct contrast of NMBR > RULE updates overlapping with interaction activity, yellow activity reflects RULE > NMBR only, and light blue activity reflects NMBR > RULE only. Bar graphs show percent signal change for each condition during each event only from those regions that showed a significant difference between rule and number during the cue period. The N, R, and B labels underneath bar graphs represent NMBR, RULE, and BOTH trials, respectively. (a) Left IFJ region percent signal change plot, (b) left IPS percent signal change plot, (c) right IPS percent signal change plot, (d) preSMA percent signal change plot. Error bars reflect ± 1 standard error of the mean.
