 The present study examined the association between psychopathic traits and functional connectivity in 177 incarcerated male adolescents. We hypothesized that psychopathic symptoms would be associated with aberrant functional connectivity within networks encompassing limbic and paralimbic regions, such as the default mode (DMN), salience networks (SN), and executive control network (ECN). The present sample was drawn from the NIMH-funded Southwest Advanced Neuroimaging Cohort, Youth sample (SWANC-Y), and from research at a youth detention facility in Wisconsin. All participants were scanned at maximum-security facilities. Psychopathic traits were assessed using Hare’s Psychopathy Checklist-Youth Version (PCL-YV). Resting-state networks were computed using group Independent Component Analysis. Associations between psychopathic traits and resting-state connectivity were assessed using Mancova analyses. PCL-YV Total score and PCL-YV Factor 1 score (interpersonal and affective traits) were associated with the power spectra of the DMN. PCL-YV Factor 1 score was associated with spatial map of the SN and the ECN. PCL-YV Factor 2 score (lifestyle and antisocial traits) was associated with spatial map of the ECN. Comparable to adult psychopathy, adolescent psychopathic traits were associated with networks implicated in self-referential thought, moral behavior, cognition, and saliency detection: functions which have previously have been reported to be disrupted in adult psychopaths.

 1. Introduction 
 Psychopathy is a serious mental health disorder characterized by interpersonal, affective and behavioral traits such as lack of guilt and remorse, glibness, and impulsivity ( Hare, 2003 ). As psychopaths are prone to violence and very likely to re-offend after release from prison, psychopathy poses a severe societal problem ( Hemphill et al., 1998 ). Research suggests that psychopathy is developmental in nature, with psychopathic traits becoming apparent before the age of 10 years ( Viding et al., 2005 ). While popular dogma holds that adult psychopaths are relatively resistant to treatment ( Kiehl and Hoffman, 2011 ), youth with elevated psychopathic traits may be susceptible to intervention programs ( Caldwell et al., 2007 ). Moreover, compared to adults, the neural correlates of psychopathic traits in children and adolescents will be less affected by the behavior itself (reversed causality) and/or environmental influences (e.g. lead exposure) and are thus more likely to reflect etiology. Examining the neurobiology of psychopathic traits in adolescents may therefore provide important insights on the development of psychopathy as well as information relevant for treatment and prevention programs. Here, we examined the association between psychopathic traits and functional connectivity in a large sample of incarcerated male adolescents. 
 As implied by the wide range of emotional and behavioral symptoms that characterize the disorder, psychopathic symptoms in both adults and adolescents have been related to functional and structural differences in limbic and paralimbic structures, such as amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal regions, anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, insula, temporal pole and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) ( Cope et al., 2014 ;  De Brito et al., 2009 ;  Ermer et al., 2013 ;  Harenski et al., 2014 ;  Kiehl et al., 2001 ;  Wallace et al., 2014 ;  Yang et al., 2011 ). For example, psychopaths are reported to have decreased amygdala, hippocampal, OFC and temporal pole volume or thickness ( Cope et al., 2014 ;  Gregory et al., 2012 ;  Yang et al., 2005 ). Moreover, psychopathy has been associated with aberrant activation in the amygdala, prefrontal and temporal cortex during moral decision-making ( Harenski et al., 2010 ;  Marsh and Cardinale, 2014 ) and while viewing emotional faces ( Contreras-Rodriguez et al., 2014 ;  Decety et al., 2014 ). 
 In recent years, there has been a significant increase in studies examining resting state functional connectivity. Functional connectivity, defined as the relation between the neuronal activation patterns of anatomically separated brain regions ( Aertsen et al., 1989 ), describes the organization, inter-relationship and integrated performance of functionally coupled brain regions ( Rogers et al., 2008 ). Thus, while task based fMRI studies provide information on brain functioning during specific behavior, resting state functional connectivity provides information on brain organization. Differences in functional connectivity have been related to several psychological disorders, such as autism and schizophrenia (e.g.  Cerliani et al., 2015 ;  Rashid et al., 2014 ). In adults, psychopathy has most markedly been associated with aberrant functional connectivity in (regions of) the default mode network (DMN), which includes the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus and angular gyrus ( Juarez, et al., 2013 ;  Motzkin et al., 2011 ;  Pujol et al., 2012 ;  Sheng et al., 2010 ). The default mode network has been implicated in self-processing and moral behavior ( Andrews-Hanna, 2012 ;  Buckner et al., 2008 ; Li et al.,), and aberrant functioning of this network may play an important role in explaining core psychopathy symptoms, such as inflated sense of self ( Hare, 2003 ), impaired emotion recognition (social perspective taking) ( Dawel et al., 2012 ), and impaired moral decision making ( Tassy et al., 2013 ). As the brain undergoes significant changes during adolescence and early adulthood ( Gogtay et al., 2004 ), adult findings cannot simply be extrapolated to youth with elevated psychopathic traits. Nevertheless, several studies in adolescent samples have also reported associations between psychopathic traits and DMN connectivity ( Aghajani et al., 2016 ;  Cohn et al., 2015 ;  Shannon et al., 2011 ). However, results by  Broulidakis et al. (2016)  suggest that the DMN is associated with conduct disorder, but not psychopathic traits. Besides the DMN, several other brain networks, such as the salience network (SN, insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC, amygdala) and executive control network (ECN, OFC), encompass paralimbic regions and may thus be involved in psychopathic behavior ( Aghajani et al., 2016 ;  Kiehl, 2006 ). 
 The present study examined the association between functional connectivity and psychopathic traits in a large sample of incarcerated adolescent boys. Based on prior resting state, but also task-based functional MRI and structural neuroimaging studies suggesting (para)limbic involvement in psychopathy (for example,  Cope et al., 2014 ;  De Brito et al., 2009 ;  Ermer et al., 2013 ;  Harenski et al., 2014 ;  Kiehl et al., 2001 ;  Pujol et al., 2012 ;  Wallace et al., 2014 ;  Yang et al., 2011 ), we hypothesized that psychopathic symptoms in incarcerated adolescents would be associated with functional connectivity within networks encompassing limbic and paralimbic brain regions, such as the DMN, SN, and ECN. 
 
 
 2. Methods 
 
 2.1 Participants 
 The present sample was drawn from the NIMH-funded Southwest Advanced Neuroimaging Cohort, Youth sample (SWANC-Y), collected between June, 2007, and May 2011 in a maximum-security facility in New Mexico and from ongoing (2011–15) research at a youth detention facility in Wisconsin. This research was approved by the University of New Mexico Human Research Review Committee. Youth provided written informed assent as well as parent/guardian written informed consent. Participants were excluded if they had a history of seizures, traumatic brain injury, psychosis, other major medical problems, or were not fluent in English at or above a grade four reading level. Resting state scans, and Psychopathy Checklist –Youth Version (PCL-YV) scores were available from n= 227 male adolescents. After excluding n= 9 for excessive motion or radiological findings and n= 17 who were met the above exclusion criteria after scanning, our final sample consisted of n= 201 participants. The sample contained 177 complete cases. Participants were paid a flat rate, yoked to the standard institutional hourly pay scale, for participation in the study. 
 
 
 2.2 Measures 
 
 2.2.1 Psychopathic Traits 
 Assessment with the PCL-YV includes a review of institutional records and a semi-structured interview regarding individuals’ school, family, work, and criminal histories, and their interpersonal and emotional skills ( Forth et al., 2003 ). Individuals are scored on 20 items that measure personality traits and behaviors characteristic of psychopathy. Scores range from 0 to 40. For adults, the accepted diagnostic cutoff for psychopathy is 30 and above. However, due to developmental issues, this cutoff is not used for adolescents. Although technically there is no Factor 1 and 2 in the PCL-YV, for comparison to adult samples, we examined a two-factor model of psychopathic traits in addition to a Total PCL-YV score, with Factor 1 composed of interpersonal and affective traits and Factor 2 composed of lifestyle and antisocial traits. Factor 1 and 2 in youth were computed the same way it is done in adults ( Hare, 2003 ). 
 This sample covered a wide range of PCL-YV scores, including a sufficient number of high scorers (PCL-YV >= 30, n = 56) indicating a high level of psychopathic traits. Interviews were conducted by trained researchers and videotaped for reliability assessment (12% of interviews (randomly selected) were double-rated; intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC 1,1) = 0.90 for PCL-YV Total score). 
 
 
 2.2.2 IQ 
 IQ was estimated from the Vocabulary and Matrix Reasoning sub-tests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition for participants older than 16 years of age, and from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children–Fourth Edition for participants younger than 16 years of age ( Wechsler, 1997 ,  2003 ). 
 
 
 2.2.3 Substance use 
 Trained researchers administered the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (KSADS) ( Kaufman et al., 1997 ). From the KSADS, we examined what substances were used. Moreover, for alcohol and cannabis, participants were asked how many months they used regularly (3 or more times/week). To approach a normal distribution, the duration of alcohol abuse was log transformed. During MRI assessment, all participants were in forced abstinence, many for at least 6 months. 
 
 
 2.2.4 Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
 Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was diagnosed by trained researchers using KSADS. 
 
 
 2.2.5 Imaging data 
 All participants were scanned at the maximum-security facilities using The Mind Research Network’s 1.5 T Avanto SQ Mobile MRI scanner. We used an EPI gradient-echo pulse sequence with TR/TE 2000/39 ms, flip angle 90°, FOV 24 × 24 cm, 64 × 64 matrix, 3.4 × 3.4 mm in-plane resolution, 5 mm slice thickness, 30 slices. Head motion was minimized using padding and restraint. During the 5-minute scan, participants were requested to look at the fixation cross hair and to keep eyes open. Participants were monitored by video. 
 
 
 
 2.3 Data analysis 
 
 2.3.1 Preprocessing 
 Functional MRI data were preprocessed using the SPM software package. The first four volumes are discarded to remove T1 equilibration effects. To correct residual head motion, “bad” images (confounded by motion or radio-frequency spikes) were estimated and removed using ART-Repair (Mazaika et al., 2007). These images were determined by calculating the mean intensity for a given time series and identifying individual images whose intensity was greater than four standard deviations from the mean. The offending image(s) were replaced in the time series by a rolling mean image, and regressed in the statistical model. Images were motion-corrected using INRIalign ( Freire and Mangin, 2001 ;  Freire et al., 2002 ). Data were spatially normalized into the standard Montreal Neurological Institute space and resampled into 3 × 3 × 3 mm voxels, resulting in 53 × 63 × 46 voxels. Next, the data were spatially smoothed with a six mm full width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel. The MRI coordinates were converted to the Talairach and Tournoux standard space to assist with anatomical labeling. However, all (x,y,z) coordinates listed in the manuscript are in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI), the default coordinate system in SPM. 
 
 
 2.3.2 Independent Component Analysis 
 Following preprocessing, a group independent component analysis (ICA) was performed in the complete sample ( Calhoun et al., 2001 ;  Calhoun and Adali, 2012 ). The methods were organized in batch scripts and performed via the group ICA of fMRI (GIFT) MATLAB toolbox version 1.3c ( http://mialab.mrn.org/software/gift ). FMRI time series data for all participants were first compressed through principal component analysis (PCA). There were two PCA data reduction stages, which reduced the impact of noise and makes the estimation computationally tractable ( Calhoun et al., 2009 ;  Erhardt et al., 2011 ;  Schmithorst and Holland, 2004 ). The first data reduction stage was set to 45 components. The final dimensionality/number of components was 30. The data reduction was followed by a group spatial ICA, performed on the participants’ aggregate data, resulting in the final estimation of our independent components (ICs) ( Calhoun et al., 2001 ). The infomax algorithm was used, which attempts to minimize the mutual information of network outputs ( Bell and Sejnowski, 1995 ). From the group spatial ICA, we reconstructed spatial maps and their corresponding ICA time courses that represented both the spatial and temporal characteristics of each component and subject using group ICA (GICA) ( Erhardt et al., 2011 ). These maps and time courses were then inspected to determine which components reflected plausible non-artifact networks. ICs that depicted peak cluster locations in gray matter with minimal overlap with white matter, ventricles and edges of the brain and also exhibit higher low frequency temporal activity were retained for further analysis. 
 A larger ICA sample size would result in a better estimate of the resting-state networks, which would be better generalizable to the population of male juvenile delinquents. We therefore decided to perform our ICA in the larger sample, and to perform the Mancova analysis in the smaller, complete case sample. 
 
 
 2.3.3 Statistical analyses 
 Associations between psychopathy and functional connectivity were tested for complete cases only (n=177) using the Mancovan toolbox implemented in GIFT ( Allen et al., 2011 ). We examined three connectivity measures: component spatial maps, component time course power spectra, and between component functional network connectivity ( Jafri, Pearlson, Stevens, & Calhoun, 2008 ). The voxel intensity in the spatial map resembles the correspondence between a voxel time course and an IC time course ( Balsters et al., 2013 ), thus providing a measure of a region’s strength of connectivity within a given network. The time course power spectra reflect the degree of fluctuation in amplitude of the intrinsic activity within the network ( Calhoun et al., 2011 ). The between component functional network connectivity represents correlations between the different components. Although ICs generated by ICA are maximally independent of each other ( Calhoun and Adali, 2006 ), their time courses can still exhibit temporal dependencies ( Arbabshirani et al., 2013 ). A multivariate selection strategy was first performed in order to identify potential significant associations between component measures and variables of interest. FNC time courses were first despiked and temporally bandpass filtered (0.01 Hz-0.15 Hz) followed by calculation of the among network connectivity matrices. The initial design matrix included psychopathy scores, and age, IQ, ADHD diagnosis, and duration of alcohol and cannabis abuse, as covariates. In addition, we included head movement estimates as nuisance regressors ( Allen et al., 2011 ), defined as the average of translation and rotation parameters. However, as results were similar with and without correction for head movement, we only report results of the model excluding motion parameters (motion corrected results are presented in  Figures S4  t/m 9 and  Table S2 ). Univariate analyses were performed within the reduced model (including only variables that showed significant associations in the multivariate stage) to test for specific relationships between predictors of interest and connectivity properties. An alpha level of 0.05 was used for all analyses. Associations between psychopathy and a priori networks of interest were first examined. For these region of interest analyses, we report both uncorrected and false discovery rate (FDR) corrected results ( Genovese, Lazar, & Nichols, 2002 ). We then performed exploratory whole brain analyses, which were corrected for multiple comparisons using FDR. 
 
 
 
 
 3. Results 
 
 3.1 Group independent component analysis 
 We performed a 30 component GICA using resting-state fMRI data from 201 participants. Demographic information on the participants is provided in  Table 1 .  Table 2  describes the correlations between the different variables in our model. Based on visual inspection of the spatial maps and power spectra, 15 components were identified as ventricular, vascular, susceptibility or motion-related artifacts ( Figure S1 ). The 15 remaining components are shown in  Figure S2  and coordinates of their peak activation are provided in  Table S1 .  Figure S3  shows the functional network connectivity. The ICA parcellation resulted in similar networks as reports in typical samples ( Beckmann et al., 2005 ;  Calhoun et al., 2008 ). As the DMN (cingulate cortex), ECN 1 (orbitofrontal cortex) and SN (cingulate cortex) include paralimbic regions, functional connectivity parameters were examined in these networks prior to the whole brain analyses. 
 
 
 3.2 Component spatial maps 
 We found no associations between PCL-Total score and networks encompassing paralimbic regions. Consistent with hypotheses, the PCL Factor 1 score was associated with functional connectivity in regions of the SN ( p  = 0.02, uncorrected,  Figure 1 ,  Table 3 ). We found mostly negative associations in frontal, temporal and medial regions, suggesting that in these regions, there was a lower correspondence between voxel time course and SN time course with increasing Factor 1 scores. Additionally, Factor 1 scores were associated with spatial maps of the ECN ( p  = 0.04, uncorrected,  Figure 2 ,  Table 3 ), with negative associations in medial, temporal, parietal, and cerebellar regions of the left hemisphere, and positive associations in the bilateral thalamus, frontal, temporal, and cerebellar regions. Also for Factor 2 scores, association with the ECN spatial map were found ( p  = 0.02, uncorrected,  Figure 3 ,  Table 3 ) in the insula, thalamus, and in frontal, temporal, and cerebellar regions. After correction for FDR, the whole-brain analyses did not provide any additional significant results. 
 
 
 3.3 Time course power spectra 
 The PCL Total Score was associated with increased amplitude at 0.0–0.05Hz and >0.2 Hz, and decreased amplitude at 0.05–0.1 Hz of the DMN ( p  = 0.02 uncorrected,  Figure 4 ). This effect seems mostly driven by Factor 1 scores, as PCL factor 1, but not Factor 2, was associated with decreased low frequency power (0.0–0.1Hz) and increased high frequency power of the DMN (uncorrected  p  = 0.03,  Figure 5a ). Only the association in the higher frequencies survived correction for multiple comparisons ( Figure 5b ). After correction for FDR, the whole-brain analyses did not provide any additional significant results. 
 
 
 3.4 Functional network connectivity 
 There were no significant associations between FNC and PCL-YV scores. 
 
 
 
 4. Discussion 
 The present study examined the association between functional connectivity and psychopathic traits in a large sample of incarcerated adolescent boys. Based on prior structural and functional neuroimaging studies on psychopathy (for example  Cope et al., 2014 ;  De Brito et al., 2009 ;  Ermer et al., 2013 ;  Harenski et al., 2014 ;  Kiehl et al., 2001 ;  Pujol et al., 2012 ;  Wallace et al., 2014 ;  Yang et al., 2011 ), we hypothesized that psychopathic symptoms would be associated with aberrant functional connectivity within networks encompassing limbic and paralimbic brain regions. PCL-Total score and Factor 1 score were associated with increased high frequency power of the DMN. Moreover, we found mostly negative associations between PCL Factor 1 scores and spatial map of the SN in frontal, temporal and medial regions of the brain, while associations between Factor 1 and spatial maps of the ECN were both negative (left hemisphere) and positive (bilateral). PCL Factor 2 scores were associated with the spatial map of the ECN in the insula, thalamus, and in frontal, temporal, and cerebellar regions. 
 In line with previous studies examining the association between adult and adolescent psychopathy and functional connectivity ( Cohn et al., 2015 ;  Contreras-Rodriguez et al., 2015 ;  Juarez et al., 2013 ;  Motzkin et al., 2011 ;  Philippi et al., 2015 ;  Pujol et al., 2012 ), our results suggest that adolescent psychopathy total score and interpersonal and affective traits are associated with increased high frequency power of the DMN. As described above, the DMN is a task-negative network which has been implicated is self-referential thought, social perspective taking, future thought, and moral behavior ( Andrews-Hanna, 2012 ). Since some of the core features of psychopathy involve self- and other referential processes, aberrant DMN activation may account for several psychopathy symptoms. For example, psychopaths are believed to have an inflated sense of self, with psychopaths often displaying egocentric and narcissistic behavior ( Hare, 2003 ). Moreover, compared to healthy adults, psychopaths have impaired emotion recognition (social perspective taking) ( Dawel et al., 2012 ), and show impaired performance on moral decision making tasks ( Tassy et al., 2013 ). 
 Studies describing associations between psychopathy and DMN connectivity generally describe results in DMN spatial maps (e.g.  Cohn et al., 2015 ) or discuss the temporal correlation between regions of the DMN (e.g.  Pujol et al., 2012 ). When the co-activation of two regions is related to psychopathic traits, these regions are interpreted to function more or less independently with increasing psychopathic traits. The interpretation of associations in spatial maps are also relatively straight forward: in the larger sample, each network comprises of a specific set of voxels, however, for individuals with more or less psychopathic traits, certain voxels or regions may be more or less involved. The origin of rs-fMRI spectral power at different frequencies currently is less well understood. Moreover, the lack of a particular task makes it difficult to characterize different brain processes across multiple subjects. The MR signal is dominated by oscillations in the 0.0–0.1 Hz frequency band. Our results suggest that psychopathic traits are associated with increased high frequency (>0.1 Hz) power. Although high frequency oscillations are often discarded due to their susceptibility to physiological noise, several studies have shown associations between higher frequency oscillations and psychiatric disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and depression ( Yu et al., 2016 ;  Yue et al., 2015 ). As our results in the DMN withstood correction for motion parameters, we believe it is unlikely that the effect in DMN power spectra could be (completely) ascribed to increased motion in participants with increased psychopathic traits. Instead, youth with increased psychopathic traits may display a less coherent pattern of DMN activation. 
 In addition to increased DMN high frequency power, adolescent interpersonal and affective traits were associated with the spatial map of the SN. The SN, which encompasses the insula and the ACC as well as the amygdala, has been implicated in assigning emotional attributes and salience to external and internal stimuli, and integrates this information to influence behavior ( Menon and Uddin, 2010 ). Indeed, several event-related potential oddball studies have reported aberrant processing of salient stimuli in psychopathic individuals ( Anderson et al., 2015 ;  Kiehl et al., 1999 ). Moreover, neuroimaging studies have repeatedly reported associations between psychopathy and ACC, insula, and amygdala structure and functioning, both during tasks and at rest. For example, compared to non-psychopathic inmates, psychopathic inmates have been reported to show reduced insula and ACC thickness as well a corresponding reduction in functional connectivity ( Ly et al., 2012 ). In a study on resting state connectivity in adult psychopaths, functional connectivity of the SN was negatively associated with Factor 1 scores, but positively associated with Factor 2 scores ( Philippi et al., 2015 ). Moreover, compared to inmates scoring low on psychopathy, psychopathic inmates showed decreased connectivity between the amygdala or temporoparietal junction and regions of the SN while watching moral images ( Yoder et al., 2015 ). 
 Both interpersonal and affective traits and lifestyle and antisocial traits were associated with the spatial map of the ECN. In our data, the ECN largely comprises of the OFC and inferior frontal cortex. Several studies have suggested that psychopathy is associated with specific executive functions ascribed to OFC functioning ( Blair et al., 2006 ;  Lantrip et al., 2016 ;  Lapierre et al., 1995 ). Although we do not report associations in the OFC per se, the associations between antisocial traits and ECN spatial map may provide support for OFC network dysfunction in psychopathy. Moreover, comparable to our results,  Cohn et al. (2015)  report associations between psychopathic impulsive and irresponsible traits—but not callous and unemotional, or grandiose-manipulative traits—and spatial map of a cognitive control network. 
 In his triple network model,  Menon (2011)  argues that deficits in the (dis)engagement of the DMN, SN, and fronto-parietal network may play a role in many psychiatric and neurological disorders. In this model, the SN plays a role in saliency detection, attentional capture and dynamic cognitive control. In case of a salient event, the SN may initiate network switching, leading to engagement of the fronto-parietal network (cognition) and disengagement of the DMN (rest). An important aspect of the model in explaining psychopathology is the inappropriate assignment of saliency to external or internal stimuli carried out by the SN. Here, we report small effects of psychopathy in both SN and DMN functional connectivity, and also report associations between psychopathy and a network involved in cognition, providing some evidence for the triple network model in psychopathy. 
 Although the DMN and the salience/cingulo-opercular network have been implicated in adult Factor 2 traits ( Philippi et al., 2015 ), the present study did not provide evidence for an association between DMN and SN functional connectivity and Factor 2 scores in adolescents. This suggests that associations between the DMN and SN and Factor 2 scores may develop later in life. These differences in functional connectivity may reflect a consequence of psychopathic antisocial traits rather than a cause of psychopathy. Moreover, the different findings for Factor 1 scores and Factor 2 scores suggest that treatment and prevention strategies for psychopathy may benefit from targeting Factor 1 and Factor 2 traits separately. 
 We did not find associations between psychopathic traits and FNC. FNC describes the co-activation of the different functional networks. Although several networks encompassing paralimbic regions are associated with psychopathic traits, psychopathy seems unrelated to between-network communication. 
 While psychopaths have been deemed untreatable, recent research shows that especially juveniles may be susceptible to treatment efforts. Instead of punishing unwanted behavior as is common in juvenile facilities, psychopaths seem to benefit from positive reinforcement ( Caldwell et al., 2007 ;  Kiehl and Hoffman, 2011 ). As our results as well as the results of other studies suggest aberrant functioning of the DMN, mindfulness meditation may also be a viable treatment option for youth with elevated psychopathic traits. Mindfulness meditation has been shown to increase functional connectivity of the DMN ( Creswell et al., 2016 ). Moreover, mindfulness has been suggested to play a role in antisocial personality disorder ( Fossati et al., 2012 ;  Velotti et al., 2016 ). Future studies may want to examine the effect of mindfulness training on psychopathic behavior. 
 Some limitations should be noted. The present sample contains only males. Due to the many differences between males and females in psychopathic traits and brain structure and functioning, and neural development ( Mutlu et al., 2013 ;  Strand and Belfrage, 2005 ;  Wang et al., 2008 ), we believe it is a good strategy to examine males and females separately. However, future research should examine whether these effects also apply to female samples. Except for the association between interpersonal and affective traits and DMN power spectra, our results did not survive FDR correction for multiple testing, and should thus be interpreted with caution. 
 In conclusion, the present study examined the association between adolescent psychopathic traits and resting-state functional connectivity in a large sample of juvenile delinquents. As comparable to studies in adults, we found associations between interpersonal and affective traits and properties of the DMN, SN, and ECN. Lifestyle and antisocial traits were associated with the ECN. These networks have been implicated in self-referential thought, moral behavior, saliency detection, and executive functioning: functions which are reported to be disrupted in psychopaths. As these networks encompass limbic and paralimbic brain regions, the present study provides evidence for paralimbic system dysfunction in psychopathy.

 Association between PCL-YV Total score and power spectra of the default mode network. Univariate tests were performed only on covariates of interest retained in the reduced MANCOVA model. Left panel depicts the significance and direction of PCL-YV Total score as a function of frequency for each component, displayed as  - sign(t)log 10 (p) . Right panel shows bar plots of the average  β -values for PCL-YV Total score term.  β  -Values were averaged over frequency bands with effects of the same directionality. The color of the bar is proportional to the fraction of contributing frequency bins; the absence of a bar indicates that either univariate tests were not performed or test statistics were not significant. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 5 
 
 Association between PCL-YV Factor 1 score and power spectra of the default mode network (A. no FDR correction, B. FDR corrected). Univariate tests were performed only on covariates of interest retained in the reduced MANCOVA model. Left panel depicts the significance and direction of PCL-YV Factor 1 as a function of frequency for each component, displayed as  - sign(t)log 10 (p) . Right panel shows bar plots of the average  β -values for PCL-YV Factor 1 term.  β -Values were averaged over frequency bands with effects of the same directionality where test statistics exceeded the FDR threshold. The color of the bar is proportional to the fraction of contributing frequency bins; the absence of a bar indicates that either univariate tests were not performed or test statistics were not significant.
