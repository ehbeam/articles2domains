 Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to assess neural
activation as participants learned to segment continuous streams of speech
containing syllable sequences varying in their transitional probabilities.
Speech streams were presented in four runs, each followed by a behavioral test
to measure the extent of learning over time. Behavioral performance indicated
that participants could discriminate statistically coherent sequences (words)
from less coherent sequences (partwords). Individual rates of learning, defined
as the difference in ratings for words and partwords, were used as predictors of
neural activation to ask which brain areas showed activity associated with these
measures. Results showed significant activity in the pars opercularis and pars
triangularis regions of the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG). The relationship
between these findings and prior work on the neural basis of statistical
learning is discussed, and parallels to the frontal/subcortical network involved
in other forms of implicit sequence learning are considered.

 1. Introduction 
 The extraction of patterns from our environment is a fundamental form of
learning that enables us to develop rich representations of objects and events in
our world. Sensitivity to statistical regularities in many domains is acquired by a
process of distributional learning.  Saffran, Newport
and Aslin (1996)  provided some of the first evidence of this
 statistical learning  mechanism in the domain of language
acquisition (see also  Saffran, Aslin, & Newport, 1996 ). They demonstrated that infants and adults
could segment word-like units from a stream of continuous speech by rapidly
calculating the transitional probabilities between syllables. Statistical learning
based on the predictability of patterns in sequences of elements has been shown
across age groups (e.g., infants and adults), species (e.g. monkeys:  Meyer & Olson, 2011 ; rats:  Toro and Trobalón, 2005 ) and modalities
(e.g., non-linguistic auditory:  Gebhart, Newport
& Aslin, 2009 ;  Saffran, Johnson,
Aslin & Newport, 1999 ; visual:  Fiser & Aslin, 2002 ). In addition, a statistical learning
approach to pattern extraction has been applied to levels of the linguistic
hierarchy ranging from phoneme discrimination (e.g.,  Maye, Werker & Gerken, 2002 ) to syntax ( Gomez & Gerken, 1999 ;  Thompson & Newport, 2007 ). These experiments demonstrate that,
in the absence of instructions or feedback, novel patterns embedded in temporally
ordered elements can be extracted by a robust and domain-general statistical
learning mechanism. 
 As noted by  Perruchet and Pacton
(2006) , studies of statistical learning share several key properties with
an older literature on artificial grammar learning (AGL). Classic AGL studies (e.g.,
 Reber, 1967 ) used strings of letters
presented simultaneously, with strings conforming to a finite-state grammar, while
other studies used visual-motor sequences in a serial reaction time (SRT) task
(e.g.,  Nissen & Bullemer, 1987 ). Both
statistical learning and AGL studies involve implicit learning 1  of patterns that contain temporal order information (see
 Reber [1967 ] for an argument that AGL
with explicit instructions may produce a different type of learning outcome). Both
statistical learning and SRT studies present rapid sequences of elements, but SRT
tasks assess learning through response speed while statistical learning and AGL rely
on a post-exposure test of familiar vs. novel strings. Thus there are commonalities
and differences that make comparisons among AGL, SRT, and statistical learning tasks
of considerable interest. 
 In particular, there is a rich literature on the neural correlates of AGL.
One of the most striking patterns that emerges across finite-state grammar
processing and motor sequencing tasks is the involvement of the basal ganglia (for a
review see  Conway & Pisoni, 2008 ), particularly the caudate ( Forkstam, Hagoort, Fernandez, Ingvar, & Petersson, 2006 ;  Peigneux et al., 2000 ;  Schendan, Searl, Melrose, & Stern, 2003 ;  Simon, Vaidya, Howard, & Howard, 2012 ) and putamen ( Grafton, Hazeltine, & Ivry, 1995 ;  Lieberman, Chang, Chiao, Bookheimer, & Knowlton, 2004 ;  Schendan et al., 2003 ). Furthermore, both learning of artificial grammar strings and subsequent classification tasks (i.e., indicating whether a given test string is grammatical or ungrammatical) have been shown to involve prefrontal areas such as the left inferior frontal gyrus ( Fletcher, Buchel, Josephs, Friston, & Dolan, 1999 ;  Forkstam et al., 2006 ;  Opitz & Friederici, 2003 ;  Petersson, Folia, & Hagoort, 2012 ;  Petersson, Forkstam, & Ingvar, 2004 ;  Skosnik et al., 2002 ). Taken together,
these findings suggest a modality-independent frontal/ basal ganglia circuit
supporting non-declarative forms of learning ( Ullman, 2004 ). 
 In contrast, there are only a handful of neuroimaging studies that have
investigated statistical learning. These studies involve three potentially separate
processes: (1) the storage of elements that occur during exposure, (2) the
computation of one or more statistics from the element distributions, and (3) the
recognition of statistically coherent (familiar) patterns after they have been
learned. In many types of experimental designs using standard analyses, these
processes can be difficult to distinguish. The goal of the present study is to
provide insights into the second process: what are the neural substrates that
mediate the computation of underlying structural information during the course of
statistical learning? We chose to employ sequences of speech syllables because they
have formed the basis of a substantial behavioral literature on statistical learning
in the context of a word-segmentation task. 
 Results obtained from neuroimaging studies of statistical learning have been
mixed, a fact potentially attributable to variation in the behavioral evidence of
learning obtained during a scanning session.  McNealy, Mazziotta & Dapretto (2006)  observed increases in
activation in left lateralized temporal cortices during exposure to continuous
streams of speech varying in syllable-to-syllable transitional probabilities.
However, they found that adult participants were unable to discriminate
statistically coherent and less coherent items during a post-exposure testing phase.
The authors proposed that the observed increases in neural activation were the
signature of word segmentation before participants could demonstrate explicit
awareness of the underlying structures. In contrast,  Cunillera et al. (2009)  conducted a joint ERP-fMRI study of auditory
word segmentation and succeeded in obtaining statistically significant behavioral
evidence of learning. Using a 2-alternative forced choice task, they found that
participants could differentiate clusters of statistically coherent syllables from
clusters of less coherent syllables. They saw increased activation during the
exposure phase in bilateral posterior superior temporal gyrus and the superior part
of the ventral premotor cortex (svPMC). Behavioral performance on the post-exposure
test phase was significantly correlated with increases in activation in svPMC during
the first two minutes of the exposure phase. 
 Examining statistical learning in the visual modality,  Turk-Browne et al. (2009)  offered additional support for the
concept of learning without awareness (i.e., before discrimination). Across the
entire exposure phase, they found that participants showed greater activation for
statistically coherent relative to random shape sequences in an extensive network of
areas including the striatum, medial temporal lobe, LOC, and ventral
occipito-temporal cortex. A more fine-grained moving window analysis revealed
differences in activation between these two conditions early on during
familiarization. In analyzing the behavioral results of the posttest, they did not
obtain evidence that participants could discriminate statistically coherent shape
sequences from less coherent sequences (but see  Turk-Browne, Scholl, Johnson & Chun, 2010  for evidence of
statistical learning during a face/scene categorization task). However, performance
during the first half of the test phase did show a significant learning effect.
Moreover, participants’ familiarity ratings of statistically coherent
sequences during the test phase were shown to correlate with LIFG activation during
the exposure phase, even though between-subject familiarity ratings did not differ
between statistically coherent and less coherent test items. 
 The foregoing findings suggest some overlap in the brain areas involved in
the computation of statistical regularities both within and across modalities.
However, since the previous fMRI studies of segmentation show mixed behavioral
evidence of statistical learning, it is challenging to compare across studies. The
present experiment addresses gaps in our understanding of the neural substrates
underlying statistical learning by first providing robust behavioral evidence of
word segmentation. Furthermore, we assessed learning at multiple time points
throughout the exposure phase, thereby providing a link between individual
participants’ rate of learning during the exposure phase and changes in
neural activation. Interestingly, most of the prior imaging work used increases in
BOLD response within the first few minutes of exposure as an index of learning
across subjects. The work of  Abla, Katahira,
& Okanoya (2008) , on the other hand, demonstrated that
participants showed considerable differences in the time course and extent of their
learning. Participants were exposed to concatenated tone sequences and tested on
their ability to differentiate statistically coherent and incoherent triplets.
Despite a high overall accuracy score, participants could be divided into low, mid,
and high learners. Event-related recordings revealed that, in the high learner
group, the first member of a tonal triplet elicited the largest N100 and N400
response during the first exposure phase. In the medium learner group, this effect
was found in the later phases, and for the low learner group no triplet onset effect
was found. These findings clearly illustrate the importance of taking into account
individual differences in learning. Correspondingly, we employed a method of
analysis that could accommodate high variability across individual learning curves,
assuming neither a monotonic increase across the exposure to the speech streams nor
an early peak in activation. We took into account the possibility that some
participants may learn quickly and then plateau or even regress in performance,
while others may require more exposure before reaching peak performance.
Importantly, this design allowed us to investigate the learning process as it
unfolds, rather than the recognition process for items already acquired or the
changes in neural responses simply due to repeated exposure to a set of stimuli. By
first addressing the question of statistical learning in a word segmentation task,
it will then be possible to compare our findings with the rich and developing
neuroimaging literature on other forms of implicit learning. Our results support the
hypothesis that regions involved in statistical learning during a word segmentation
task share certain commonalities with neural circuits that are activated in other
sequence learning tasks used in the AGL and SRT literatures. 
 
 
 2. Materials and Methods 
 
 2.1 Participants 
 A total of 34 undergraduates recruited from the University of Rochester
completed the study. However, of that number, only 25 were included in the
analyses presented here (17 female, mean age= 20.5 years, range=18–23).
Two participants were excluded because they exceeded our cut-off for excess head
motion (> 3.0mm in any direction), and 7 participants had to be excluded
due to technical malfunctions that resulted in decreased exposure to the
miniature artificial language. All participants gave written informed consent
according to the protocol approved by the University of Rochester Research
Subjects Review Board and were compensated $30. Participants were right-handed,
native speakers of English without any known neurological problems or
learning disabilities. 
 
 
 2.2 Stimuli and procedure 
 Participants completed alternating runs of exposure and testing. Prior
to the start of the experiment, they were instructed to relax and listen
attentively to the stimulus materials. They were also informed that they should
expect tests on the familiarity of aspects of the language. In this way, we
ensured that any learning that occurred during the first exposure phase would
not differ fundamentally from learning during later exposure phases. 
 Auditory and visual materials were displayed using the presentation
software DirectRT v.2008 (Empirisoft Corporation, NY). Visual stimuli were
projected onto a screen located in the rear of the magnet bore using a Titan
model sx+ 3D projector (Digital Projection, Inc., GA). The screen was visible to
the participants through a small mirror mounted above the eyes at an angle of
45° (viewing distance= 0.8m). Auditory stimuli were presented using
pneumatic headphones (Resonance Technology Inc., CA). Participants wore earplugs
to reduce the ambient noise of the scanner and made responses using a
custom-built MR-safe button box held in their right hand. 
 
 2.2.1 Exposure phase 
 Participants were exposed to a modified version of the miniature
artificial language presented in  Newport and
Aslin (2004) . This particular language was chosen due to the
speed and robustness with which it was acquired, rendering it adaptable to a
block design mode of presentation in the scanner. In previous behavioral
work in a quiet environment outside of the scanner,  Gebhart, Aslin and Newport (2009)  showed evidence of
learning this language after only 5 minutes of exposure. The speech stream
contained six consonants (b, p, d, t, g, k) and 6 vowels (a, i, u, e, o,
ae), which were combined to form 12 consonant-vowel syllables (pa, gi, tae,
gu, te, po, da, ki, ku, bae, bu, do) and 16 trisyllabic words. An equal
number of tokens of the 16 trisyllabic words were concatenated into a
continuous stream with the constraint that two identical words could not
occur in direct succession and that each syllable at the end of a word could
only be followed by one of two different word-initial syllables. These
constraints ensured that the transitional probabilities between
 non-adjacent  phonetic segments (consonants) within a
word were 1.0. In contrast, the transitional probabilities between
 adjacent  phonetic segments (consonant→vowel or
vowel→ consonant) and syllables within a word were 0.5 and the
transitional probabilities between non-adjacent phonetic segments and
syllables across a word boundary were 0.5. The speech stream was synthesized
using the female voice Victoria in MacinTalk© with a flat monotone
setting so that the stream contained no pauses or prosodic cues to indicate
word boundaries and were further edited using Sound Edit 16 version 2, in
order to ensure that all syllable durations, both within and across words,
were approximately the same. 
 The experiment consisted of 4 separate exposure phases each followed
by a short testing phase. Before the first exposure phase, participants were
instructed to relax and listen attentively to 3 different types of sound
streams, each of which would be paired with a color cue indicating the type
of stream being presented. The “languages” consisted of
continuous streams of (1) forward speech, (2) backward speech formed by
playing the recording of the forward speech stream in reverse, and (3)
overlaid speech formed by layering three copies of the forward stream on top
of one another with a slight temporal offset between them. Because we tested
on forward and backward items, but not overlaid items, forward and backward
speech streams afforded the most comparable task-relevant use of cognitive
resources in this design. Therefore, for the purpose of this study, the
analyses will focus on forward speech and its matched control condition of
backward speech. Though the backward speech still technically contained
statistical regularities, it was selected as an appropriate control because
participants were largely unable to  extract  these
regularities. Extensive behavioral pilot testing revealed that participants
could not successfully compute the statistical relationships between
syllables in the reversed stream as they did for the forward stream. 
 Participants were asked to listen passively during the 4 exposure
phases. Stimuli during these phases were presented using a blocked design,
with the ordering of the three language streams counterbalanced across
participants within each exposure phase. Block duration was 30 seconds, with
interleaved 15-second periods of silence paired with a black screen to serve
as a baseline condition ( Figure 1 ).
Auditory fade-in and fade-out effects were applied to the beginnings and
ends of each block to ensure that participants would not be able to
determine the precise beginning and end of each type of stream and therefore
could not make use of this potential cue to word boundaries. Within each of
the 4 exposure phases, participants listened to a total of 2 minutes of each
language. 
 
 
 2.2.2 Test phase 
 Following each of the 4 exposure runs, participants were tested on
their recognition of forward and backward ‘words’ and
‘partwords’ that occurred in the exposure streams. Words
were defined as those 3-syllable combinations with high transitional
probabilities between non-adjacent phonetic segments (consonants) within the
word and low transitional probabilities between consonants, vowels, and
syllables across word boundaries. Partwords were statistically less
consistent groupings of 3 syllables that consisted of the end of one word
and the beginning of another: one pair of consonants within the partword had
a low transitional probability while the other pair of consonants had
transitional probabilities of 1.0. In each test, participants were presented
with 16 items (4 forward words, 4 forward partwords, 4 backward words, and 4
backward partwords, in random order) and were asked to rate each one on a
scale of 1 (definitely unfamiliar) to 4 (definitely familiar). Participants
had 2 seconds to indicate their response on the button box. Participants
were tested on both forward and backward items in order to verify that they
extracted word boundaries from forward speech but not from backward speech.
If participants demonstrated no rating difference between backward words and
partwords, then we could confidently use backward speech as a valid control
for studying learning of our forward speech stream. Although we were only
interested in collecting functional imaging data during the exposure phase,
we continued to scan during each of the testing phases in order to maintain
similar ambient noise conditions throughout the entire experiment. 
 
 
 
 2.3 MR acquisition parameters 
 Data were acquired on a Siemens Trio 3T MRI scanner equipped with an
8-channel head coil. To reduce head motion and cumulative head drift, foam
padding was used to secure the head and neck of participants. Thirty T2*
-weighted gradient echo (GE) echo-planar axial slices were collected in an
interleaved order with a TR of 2000ms (TE= 30ms, flip angle= 90°, voxel
size = 4.0mm 3 , FOV=256mm). Data from 277 time points were collected
for each of the 4 exposure runs. Data from the 4 post-exposure tests were not
included in the analyses presented here for the reasons described in section
2.2.2. At the end of the session, a high-resolution T1-weighted whole brain
volume was acquired using an MPRAGE sequence (TR= 2530ms, TE= 3.39ms, flip
angle= 90°, voxel size= 1.3x1.0x1.0mm 3 , FOV=256mm). 
 
 
 2.4 Behavioral data analysis 
 Both reaction times and rating scores were obtained for each of the 4
tests. Data were excluded from trials in which the participants exceeded the
2-second time window to indicate a response (2.2% of 1600 total trials).
A three-way repeated measures ANOVA was performed in which language (forward or
backward speech), test number, and test item type (word or partword) were
entered as within-subjects factors. Next, we performed planned comparisons in
order to determine the source of significant effects obtained when running the
ANOVA. Because these comparisons were planned, they underwent Least Significant
Difference adjustment rather than multiple comparisons correction ( Keppel & Wickens, 2004 ). 
 
 
 2.5 MR data analysis 
 
 2.5.1 Preprocessing 
 Analyses were carried out using FEAT (fMRI Expert Analysis Tool),
part of the FSL software package (FSL, version 5.98, FMRIB, Oxford, UK,
 www.fsl.ox.a-c.uk/fsl , see also  Smith et al., 2004 ;  Woolrich et al., 2009 ). The first 3 volumes of each functional
run were discarded to avoid the effects of any start-up magnetization
transients in the data. Motion correction was then applied to each run using
MCFLIRT ( Jenkinson, Bannister, Brady,
& Smith, 2002 ). Data from two participants were excluded
from the analyses due to excessive head motion (> 3.0mm in any
direction). Additional preprocessing steps included: slice timing
correction, skull-stripping using the BET tool ( Smith, 2002 ), spatial smoothing using an isotropic 3D
Gaussian kernel (full-width-half-maximum = 5mm), grand mean-based intensity
normalization of all volumes by the same factor, and non-linear high pass
temporal filtering to reduce low frequency artifacts. Single-subject and
group-level statistical analyses were then performed. 
 
 
 2.5.2 Whole-brain analysis 
 First level statistical analysis was carried out using FILM
(FMRIB’s Improved Linear Model). Each type of speech (forward,
backward and overlaid speech) was entered as a separate explanatory variable
(EV). For each individual run, parameter estimates for forward, backward,
and overlaid speech relative to baseline as well as for contrasts of
interest (e.g., forward>backward) were calculated. In order to
combine data across runs for each participant, these coefficients were then
input into a GLM in which the random effects variance was forced to zero
using FLAME (FMRIB’s Local Analysis of Mixed Effects) ( Beckmann, Jenkinson, & Smith,
2003 ;  Woolrich et al.,
2004 ). Registration to high-resolution images and the MNI-152
structural template was performed using FLIRT ( Jenkinson & Smith, 2001 ). 
 At second level, the following explanatory variables were then
entered for each participant: (EV1) all four runs were assigned equal weight
and (EV2) delta analysis: a demeaned learning score was input for each run
based on the behavioral performance of each participant on the test phase
following that run. The learning score was calculated as the change in
forward rating [word rating-partword rating] from the previous run:
Δ= (forward word rating-forward partword rating) TestN  -
(forward word rating- forward partword rating) TestN-1 . The
learning score for the first run was calculated as the change in forward
word partword rating from 0, as there would be no difference in familiarity
of words and partwords prior to any speech stream exposure. This delta EV
was orthogonalized with respect to the mean response EV in order to capture
the  additional  effects of learning on patterns of neural
activity for the contrasts forward>backward and vice versa. Z-
(Gaussianized T/F statistic) images were thresholded using Z >2.3
and a corrected cluster significance threshold of p = 0.05 ( Worsley, Evans, Marrett, & Neelin,
1992 ). 
 The inclusion of the delta scores as an additional covariate reveals
fluctuations in neural activity predicted by individual shifts in behavioral
performance across the 4 test phases. We opted to use the
 change  in word/partword difference, as opposed to the
absolute difference, because the delta better captures the learning process.
Consider a scenario in which a participant shows a small word-partword
difference on test 1, and then large differences between word and partword
ratings on both of the next two tests (tests 2 and 3). This pattern of
scores would suggest that most of the learning occurred during the exposure
phase preceding test 2, with little learning – simply maintenance of
what had already been learned – between tests 2 and 3. In this
example, the learning process that occurred between tests 1 and 2 differs
from the form of processing that occurred between tests 2 and 3. Because the
purpose of this study was to determine the brain areas supporting the
formation, not the maintenance, of structural representations, we elected to
use a measure of  change  in performance that would reflect
this process. 
 After obtaining coefficients for each participant at second level,
the neural response across participants was subsequently modeled using FLAME
(FMRIB's Local Analysis of Mixed Effects) stage 1 and 2 ( Beckmann et al., 2003 ;  Woolrich et al., 2004 ). Z-statistic
images for the mean activation were thresholded using clusters determined by
Z>2.3 and a corrected cluster significance threshold of
p = 0.05. Because the delta effects were slightly weaker, the maps
based on these coefficients were thresholded using Z>1.9 and a
corrected cluster significance threshold of p = 0.05 ( Worsley et al., 1992 ). 
 
 
 2.5.3 Region of interest (ROI) analysis 
 Based on data from prior sequence learning studies (e.g.,  Forkstam et al., 2006 ;  Schendan et al., 2003 ), as well as the
basal ganglia activation obtained in  McNealy
et al. (2006)  and  Turk-Browne et
al. (2009) , we hypothesized a pattern of neural activation
encompassing specific subcortical areas. Therefore, separate analyses were
conducted in which pre-threshold masks were applied to the group-level
activation maps for the delta analysis (uncorrected, p = 0.05). The
masks consisted of bilateral caudate and putamen defined anatomically by the
MNI structural atlas. Their application served to constrain our analysis to
specific areas for which we had a strong  a priori 
hypothesis of activation relevant to statistical learning. 
 
 
 
 
 3. Results and Discussion 
 
 3.1 Behavioral results 
 A three-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant main effect
of the test item type (word or partword) on the rating of triplet sequences
(F(1,24)=17.89, p<0.0001, partial eta squared=0.43). Moreover, we found
a significant interaction between the language (that is, the direction of the
speech stream, forward or backward) and test item type (F(1,24)= 9.25,
p<0.01, partial eta squared=0.28). Planned comparisons were then carried
out to determine the source of these effects, with the results indicating that
for the forward stream, words were rated significantly higher than partwords for
each of the four tests (test 1: mean word=2.73, mean partword=2.34, F(1,24)=
5.25, p=0.03, partial eta squared=0.18; test 2: mean word=2.99, mean
partword=2.54, F(1,24)=5.70, p=0.03, partial eta squared=0.19; test 3: mean
word=3.14, mean partword=2.36, F(1,24)=18.33 p<0.001, partial eta
squared=0.43; test 4: mean word=2.95, mean partword=2.49, F(1,24)=6.37 p=0.02,
partial eta squared=0.21).  Figure 2A 
illustrates the mean rating differences for forward stream words and partwords.
When planned comparisons were performed on  backward  items,
however, no significant differences were found on three of the four tests (test
1: mean word=2.50, mean partword=F(1,24)=0.57, p=0.46, partial eta squared=0.02;
test 2: mean word=2.60, mean partword=2.43, F(1,24)=2.94, p=0.10, partial eta
squared=0.11; test 4: mean word=2.49, mean partword=2.42, F(1,24)=0.63, p=0.44,
partial eta squared=0.03). As  Figure 2B 
shows, a significant difference was found for the backward stream words compared
to partwords for test 3 only (mean word=2.63, mean partword=2.37, F(1,24)=5.65,
p=0.03, partial eta squared=0.19). 
 Although any learning from the backward stream was unexpected given our
pilot results, previous work has shown that adult participants can extract
certain types of regularities from non-linguistic auditory stimuli given
sufficient exposure ( Gebhart, Newport, et al.,
2009 ). Note that despite showing some inconsistent sensitivity to
transitional probabilities in backward speech for test 3, the rating difference
between words and partwords was greater overall for forward sequences compared to backward sequences (mean
forward difference = 0.52, SD = 0.68; mean backward difference = 0.10,
SD = 0.21; t(24) = 3.04, p < 0.01) ( Figure 2C ). That is, participants
may have extracted some statistical information from the backward stream, but,
as revealed by the three-way ANOVA and planned comparisons, they learned
significantly and substantially  better  during exposure to the
forward stream. While there is extensive behavioral evidence that statistical
regularities drive the acquisition of structure across domains, statistical
learning is not necessarily equivalent for all types of stimuli. For example,
Gebhart et al. found that, in order for successful segmentation to take place on
a stream of complex and unfamiliar auditory noises, participants had to undergo
a period of exposure that was 5 times longer than the exposure necessary for the
segmentation of speech or music. The reduced ability of participants to segment
reversed speech in the present study does not preclude the possibility that,
given enough exposure, they would eventually be able to do so. Our results
 do  indicate, however, that this reduced ability makes
backward speech a suitable control for the rapid extraction of statistics during
exposure to forward syllable streams. 
 
 
 3.2 Whole brain analyses 
 
 3.2.1 Forward speech streams compared to control 
 Before taking temporal changes and measures of learning into
account, a whole brain analysis was performed in order to investigate mean
differences between the forward and backward conditions. As described in
section 2.5.2, activation maps across participants were created for the
contrasts forward > backward and backward > forward. For the
purposes of this particular analysis, participants were not divided based on
the extent of their learning during the four testing points. The goal here
was to determine which areas showed overall differences in activation during
the presentation of forward streams relative to our control streams and to
evaluate our findings with respect to prior work making use of similar
contrasts (e.g., structured v. unstructured syllable streams). 
 Similar to previous studies contrasting statistically coherent and
randomized syllable streams ( Cunillera et al.,
2009 ;  McNealy et al.,
2006 ), we obtained greater activation in the left superior
temporal gyrus for the forward speech stream compared to our backward
control ( Table 1 ) 2 . This left-lateralized cluster in temporal cortex
extended to portions of the middle temporal gyrus, the postcentral gyrus,
and the supramarginal gyrus ( Figure
4A ). Some homologous regions in right temporal cortex were found as
well, including the posterior portions of the middle temporal and superior
temporal gyri. The right-lateralized cluster had a smaller spatial extent
than its left hemisphere counterpart. 
 We also observed one cluster of activation that was greater in
response to backward speech than forward speech. Aligning with prior work
suggesting the superiority of the right hemisphere for processing of
reversed speech (e.g.,  Kimura &
Folb, 1968 ), this area encompassed the right angular gyrus and
posterior division of the supramarginal gyrus. In addition, this right
lateralized cluster overlaps in part with temporoparietal areas showing
increased activation in response to unexpected or higher entropy sequences
during the processing of patterned tone stimuli ( Furl et al., 2011 ;  Overath
et al., 2007 ). While the left hemisphere areas showing greater response for
forward relative to backward speech may support the processing of familiar,
more predictable stimuli, the right hemisphere areas obtained with the
opposite contrast may reflect neural response to unexpected, high entropy,
or unusual stimuli. 
 
 
 3.2.2 Delta analysis: Neural correlates of learning-related
changes 
 Though the basic comparison of forward speech streams and backward
control streams was informative, it revealed little more than that there are
differences in some aspect of the processing of forward and reversed streams
of speech. This contrast alone cannot capture the neural substrate(s)
underlying the learning process because it does not provide a link between
behavioral measures of learning and fluctuations in neural activity.
Assigning equal weights to each of the four exposure runs (as described in
analysis 3.2.1) required the following assumptions: (1) each participant
learned to the same extent in each run and (2) each participant’s
rate of learning was consistent across runs. However,  Figure 3  illustrates the considerable amount of
variability in behavioral performance between participants, shown here as
the change in forward word-partword rating from one test to the next. While
some participants showed evidence of learning very quickly, others did not
show a jump in word-partword rating difference until the third or fourth
exposure phase. These results highlight the importance of taking into
account individual differences during the entirety of the learning
process. 
 The pattern of activation seen in  Figure 4B  was the result of relating each participant’s
change in learning across the four post-exposure test phases to changes in
neural activity during the forward as compared to the backward exposure
phase. This delta analysis resulted in a cluster of activation localized in
the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) pars triangularis and a small portion
of the pars opercularis (peak activation at MNI coordinates x=−52,
y=26, z=−6). The same delta analysis applied to the reverse
contrast, backward speech> forward speech, resulted in no
significant activation. 
 
 
 3.2.3 The role of the LIFG 
 Broca’s area, or the posterior portion of left inferior
frontal gyrus (BA 44/45), has traditionally been viewed as having a
specifically linguistic function, controlling speech production or serving
as the seat of syntax (e.g.,  Broca,
1861 ;  Geschwind, 1970 ;
 Sakai, Hashimoto, & Homae,
2001 ;  Santi & Grodzinsky,
2007a , b ). However, recent
hypotheses about the functions of the LIFG hold that it may play a more
general role in the processing of linguistic and also certain types of
non-linguistic materials (e.g.,  Hugdhal,
Thomsen, & Ersland, 2006 ;  Tillman, Janata & Bharucha, 2003 ). From a cognitive
control perspective, a general regulatory function has been attributed to
the LIFG, supporting the resolution of competing representations in
phonological processing, sentence processing, and semantic retrieval ( Moss et al., 2005 ;  Novick, Trueswell & Thompson-Schill,
2005 ;  2010 ). Taking a
similarly integrative approach,  Petersson et
al. (2012)  proposed that “the left inferior frontal
region is a generic on-line structured sequence processor that unifies
information from various sources in an incremental and recursive
manner” (p. 85). Our findings extend such interpretations of the
LIFG and suggest that it functions not only as a sequence processor, but
also as a substrate that drives sequence learning through the computation of
statistical regularities and the formation of structural
representations. 
 While the data obtained here can speak only to the role of the LIFG
in an auditory linguistic task, neuroimaging results obtained from studies
of visual and auditory non-linguistic processing raise the possibility that
this area subserves domain-general statistical processing.  Turk-Browne et al. (2009)  observed that
familiarity ratings of shape sequences were correlated with activation in
LIFG. Moreover,  Abla and Okanoya
(2008)  found a similar relationship between the segmentation of
continuous tone sequences and activity in inferior frontal cortex.
Participants were first trained on isolated tone triplets. Next, these
statistically coherent triplets were concatenated in a continuous stream and
presented in alternation with random tone sequences. Multichannel
near-infrared spectroscopy recordings revealed greater changes localized
near Broca’s area in oxy-hemoglobin response for the structured
relative to the unstructured condition. Given that similar results were
obtained by Turk-Browne et al. and Alba and Okanoya in both visual and
auditory segmentation studies, it is possible that LIFG operates in a
modality-independent fashion. It may play a key role in the integration of
sequential information, regardless of the modality of presentation. This
hypothesis also fits with accounts of the neural circuits involved in
implicit learning, described by many investigators as extending from
portions of the basal ganglia to prefrontal areas. 
 
 
 
 3.3 Word segmentation and sequence learning circuitry 
 
 3.3.1 ROI analysis: Caudate and putamen involvement in
segmentation 
 While a whole-brain delta analysis resulted in a cluster localized
to the LIFG, a more sensitive measure was needed in order to examine the
possibility of basal ganglia involvement during word segmentation. When
separate pre-threshold striatal masks were applied to the group-level maps
obtained from the delta analysis, activation was also revealed in bilateral
caudate (peak MNI coordinates for RH: x=10, y=8, z=18, max Z= 2.300; LH:
x=−20, y=16, z=10, max Z=2.733) and putamen (peak coordinates for
RH: x=30, y=16, z=−2, max Z=2.605; LH: x=−20, y=16, z=10,
max Z=2.733), indicating a subcortical component in addition to the
prefrontal region obtained in the whole-brain delta analysis. This result
suggests a potential circuit of areas underlying statistical learning and
complements connectivity data showing that prefrontal cortex actually
mediates activity across multiple learning and memory systems (e.g.,  Poldrack & Rodriguez,
2004 ). 
 
 
 3.3.2 Neural basis of modality-independent sequence learning 
 Given the commonalities between statistical learning tasks and other
tasks that involve high demands on memory for sequential information, there
is reason to consider substantial overlap in the neural structures
supporting them.  Ullman (2001 ,  2004 ) has posited a distinction in
language between a declarative memory system involving medial temporal lobe
structures and the so-called procedural memory system involving frontal,
subcortical, parietal and cerebellar areas.  Ullman et al. (1997)  proposed that the declarative system, which
is responsible for fast fact learning, is necessary for the formation of the
mental lexicon. On the other end of the spectrum, the procedural system
underlies domain-general cognitive abilities that cannot be accessed
consciously or described explicitly. Procedural learning encompasses
non-declarative skills (e.g., swinging a golf club), but it seems to be
specialized for the real-time, incremental processing of rules, especially
those governing relationships between any sort of sequentially presented
stimuli (e.g., grammar learning or serial reaction time tasks). As
previously stated, this form of learning corresponds closely to the sort of
implicit processing driving statistical learning, and, indeed, the current
study of word segmentation demonstrates patterns of activation that map onto
frontal and subcortical structures within the proposed procedural network.
Anatomical data lend support to such a network, as there are extensive fiber
tracts connecting prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia. Though many
tracts project  into  the basal ganglia, the primary
 output  of the basal ganglia first passes through the
thalamus and then projects to prefrontal cortex (e.g.,  Alexander, Delong & Strick, 1986 ). This result
also fits with the monkey physiology work of  Pasupathy and Miller (2005) , which showed that activity in basal
ganglia was related to rapid associative learning, while slow improvements
in performance over time were correlated with activity in prefrontal
areas. 
 
 
 
 3.4 Conclusions 
 The present study has provided several advances in our understanding of
the neural substrates underlying statistical learning. By presenting speech
streams whose structure could be learned rapidly, even in the scanner
environment, we obtained significant behavioral evidence that participants made
use of statistical information in order to perform our segmentation task. We
then capitalized on individual variations in the time-course of learning by
assessing behavioral performance at multiple time points (after each of several
repeated exposure phases). These assessments of learning enabled us to search
for those regions in which neural activation was associated with
 changes  in performance over the experiment, rather than
examining activation in relationship to only a single outcome measure of
learning after all exposure phases were completed. Thus we were able to focus on
the learning process itself rather than the outcome of learning or the resulting
recognition of familiar element sequences. The neuroimaging results from these
whole brain analyses suggested that specific subdivisions of the left inferior
frontal gyrus mediate, at least in part, statistical learning at the level of
individual participants. Moreover, a region of interest analysis implicated a
subcortical component encompassing areas of the basal ganglia that participate
in this learning process as well. 
 Our findings, when taken together with prior work on the neural
correlates of statistical learning, suggest that these regions, particularly the
LIFG, are involved in extracting temporally ordered pattern information
regardless of the modality of the input. However, because this study involves
only spoken language stimuli, further neuroimaging work is needed to confirm
this domain-general hypothesis. Finally, given that much of the work on
statistical and other forms of implicit learning has involved the processing of
sequences, additional study is needed in order to determine whether the LIFG and
basal ganglia also mediate learning of element relationships that are spatially,
rather than temporally, organized (e.g.,  Fiser
& Aslin, 2005 ).

 In using the term  implicit learning , we refer to a form
of learning in which participants are able to extract structure from the stimuli
presented to them but are unable to accurately verbalize exactly what rule or
pattern they relied on in discriminating structured from unstructured test items
(e.g.,  Reber, 1967 ;  Turk-Browne, Scholl, Chun & Johnson, 2009 ). In the
present study we have not tested directly whether learning is implicit, but our
prior studies using the same paradigm suggest that this type of learning is
largely implicit. 
 
 
 2 
 In addition, we obtained a significant cluster in posterior regions of
the occipital lobe. This pattern seems best accounted for by the fact that we
paired each stream with a different color cue. We did so to assist participants
in clearly differentiating the stream types. Indeed, previous findings
demonstrate that explicitly indicating to participants that they are listening
to different languages facilitates learning ( Gebhart, Aslin, et al., 2009 ). Therefore, we made use of color cues in order
to obtain strong behavioral evidence of learning as exposure proceeded in our
participants. These color cues were presented as a whole-field background,
producing large changes in spectral intensity and luminance at the start of each
stimulus condition. While we cannot discount a participation of occipital cortex
in the auditory learning under study here, it is well accepted that such large
visual transients would lead to the robust occipital activation reported.

 Figure 1 
 
 Exposure phase presented in a blocked design. In each of 4 runs,
participants listened to 2 minutes each of forward, backward and overlaid speech
streams. Each type of speech stream was paired with a unique color cue.
30-second blocks of language exposure were interleaved with 15-second periods of
silence. The total duration of each run was approximately 8 minutes and 30
seconds. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 2 
 
 Differences in word and partword rating for test items presented as
forward speech and as backward speech. (A) Forward words were rated as
significantly more familiar than forward partwords on each test. (B) Backward
words were rated significantly higher than backward partwords only on test 3.
(C) The rating difference between words and partwords presented in forward
speech was significantly higher than the rating difference for items presented
in backward speech. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 3 
 
 Variability in learning. On each test, participants’
delta-learning scores across tests spanned a wide range (measured as change in
forward W-PW rating for each test as compared to the test preceding it). The
mean change in rating for each test is indicated in red.

 Results of whole brain analysis with sagittal sections removed (A) Mean
activation in response to forward > backward continuous speech streams
(Z>2.3, p<0.05) (B) Neural changes related specifically to
learning in the left inferior frontal gyrus as revealed by a delta analysis
performed on the contrast forward >backward (Z>1.9,
p<0.05).
