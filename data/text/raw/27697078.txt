development of psychotic symptoms and the onset of psychotic disorders. The aim of the
present study was to explore longitudinal alterations in salience processing in
ultra-high-risk subjects for psychosis. Method A total of 23 ultra-high-risk subjects and 13 healthy controls underwent functional
magnetic resonance imaging at two time points (mean interval of 17 months) while
performing the Salience Attribution Test to assess neural responses to task-relevant
(adaptive salience) and task-irrelevant (aberrant salience) stimulus features. Results At presentation, high-risk subjects were less likely than controls to attribute
salience to relevant features, and more likely to attribute salience to irrelevant
stimulus features. These behavioural differences were no longer evident at follow-up.
When attributing salience to relevant cue features, ultra-high-risk subjects showed less
activation than controls in the ventral striatum at both baseline and follow-up. Within
the high-risk sample, amelioration of abnormal beliefs over the follow-up period was
correlated with an increase in right ventral striatum activation during the attribution
of salience to relevant cue features. Conclusions These findings confirm that salience processing is perturbed in ultra-high-risk
subjects for psychosis, that this is linked to alterations in ventral striatum function,
and that clinical outcomes are related to longitudinal changes in ventral striatum
function during salience processing. Key words Clinical high risk for psychosis longitudinal studies motivational salience psychosis ventral striatum Introduction According to the aberrant salience model of psychosis (Heinz,  2002 ; Kapur,  2003 ; Howes
& Murray,  2014 ), psychotic symptoms develop
as a result of the inappropriate assignment of salience to contextually irrelevant internal
and external experiences. This model is supported by evidence that patients with
schizophrenia respond faster to task-irrelevant stimulus features than healthy controls
(HCs) (Pankow  et al. 
 2016 ), and that patients with prominent delusions
rate irrelevant stimuli as more potentially rewarding than patients without delusions
(Roiser  et al. 
 2009 ). This ‘aberrant’ attribution of salience is
also evident in people at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis, who are more likely to
attribute salience to irrelevant stimulus features than HCs, with this tendency again
related to the severity of abnormal beliefs (Roiser  et al. 
 2013 ). Experiments in animals suggest that stimuli become motivationally salient when the release
of dopamine in the striatum coincides with their perception (Schultz  et al. 
 1997 ; Kapur,  2003 ). In healthy individuals, aberrant salience measures are positively associated
with ventral striatal (VS) presynaptic dopamine levels (Boehme  et al. 
 2015 ). Dopamine function in the striatum is
abnormally elevated in both schizophrenia (Reith  et al. 
 1994 ; Laruelle  et al. 
 1996 ; Breier  et al. 
 1997 ; Laruelle  et al. 
 1999 ; Abi-Dargham  et al. 
 2000 ; Kumakura  et al. 
 2007 ; Howes & Kapur,  2009 ; Howes  et al. 
 2012 ) and UHR subjects (Howes  et
al .  2009 b ,  2011 a ,  
 b 
 ; Egerton  et al. 
 2013 ; Mizrahi  et al. 
 2014 ) and the aberrant salience hypothesis proposes
that this causes attribution of salience to irrelevant stimuli (Heinz &
Schlagenhauf,  2010 ; Winton-Brown  et al. 
 2014 ). In addition, it has been hypothesized that
because dopaminergic neurons may show more burst firing in psychosis (Goto & Grace,
 2005 ; Winton-Brown  et al. 
 2014 ) the normal phasic dopaminergic response to
relevant stimuli may become relatively diminished due to the high level of noise in the
system (Heinz,  2002 ; Kapur,  2003 ; Howes  et al. 
 2009 a ). Psychosis may thus be
associated with a reduced attribution of salience to relevant stimuli as well as increased
attribution of salience to irrelevant stimuli. This is consistent with data from recent
studies in UHR subjects and in patients with psychosis, which report impairments in both
forms of salience processing (Roiser  et al. 
 2009 ,  2013 , Pankow  et al .  2016 ). Data from functional neuroimaging studies suggest that UHR subjects and patients with
psychosis show altered activation in the VS during tasks that engage motivational salience
processing. A recent meta-analysis suggested that reduced VS responses occur in patients
with schizophrenia spectrum disorders relative to controls during the processing of
contextually relevant information and that left VS hypoactivation was more severe in
patients with high scores of negative symptoms (Radua  et al. 
 2015 ). The relationship between VS activation
during reward prediction and positive symptoms requires further investigation because only
six studies were available (Simon  et al. 
 2010 ; Esslinger  et al. 
 2012 ; Nielsen  et al. 
 2012 a ; Roiser  et al. 
 2013 ; Wotruba  et al. 
 2014 ; de Leeuw  et al. 
 2015 ) and there was residual heterogeneity among
them (Radua  et al. 
 2015 ). Interestingly, individual treatment with
antipsychotics was associated with a normalization of VS activation during reward
prediction, and this improvement was associated with the improvement of positive symptoms
(Nielsen  et al. 
 2012 b ). With respect to
contextually irrelevant information, it has been shown that striatal activation during
incorrect distracter trials was positively correlated with aberrant salience symptoms in
schizophrenia patients (Ceaser & Barch,  2015 ). In UHR subjects, the VS response to irrelevant stimulus features was found to
be associated with the severity of abnormal beliefs (Roiser  et al. 
 2013 ). However, it is not known if altered VS
activation during salience processing normalizes in UHR individuals whose psychotic symptoms
have remitted. The Salience Attribution Test (SAT) is a paradigm that can be used to assess task-relevant
and task-irrelevant motivational salience responses, termed adaptive and aberrant salience,
respectively (Roiser  et al. 
 2009 ,  2010 ). Our objective was to assess the relationship between changes in clinical
features in a UHR cohort and longitudinal changes in VS activation elicited during the SAT
paradigm. Our first hypothesis was that at clinical presentation, UHR subjects would show
increased aberrant but reduced adaptive salience processing compared with HCs, and that
these differences would be associated with concomitant alterations in VS activation. Our
second hypothesis was that clinical improvements the UHR subjects subsequent to presentation
would be associated with a longitudinal normalization of behavioural and neural responses
during salience processing. Method Participants A total of 29 individuals who met the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States
(CAARMS) (Yung  et al. 
 2005 ) criteria for the UHR state were recruited
from Outreach and Support in South London (OASIS; Fusar-Poli  et al. 
 2013 b ), a clinical service for
people at high risk for psychosis. According to international standard UHR criteria (for a
comprehensive review, see Fusar-Poli  et al. 
 2013 a ), inclusion required the
presence of one or more of the following: (i) presence of attenuated psychosis symptoms
(APS); (ii) genetic risk and deterioration syndrome (GRD); or (iii) brief limited and
intermittent psychotic symptoms (BLIPS). In all, 24 individuals were included based on
APS, three based on BLIPS and two based on APS + GRD. Following presentation, all subjects
were provided with clinical care from OASIS (Fusar-Poli  et al. 
 2013 b ). Three subjects received
antipsychotic medication and were thus excluded from the analysis. Of the subjects, 26
also received cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT), which at the time of writing had been
completed in nine subjects (26 sessions on average, range 14–65). Of the subjects, seven
received low-dose antidepressants: five citalopram (3 × 20, 1 × 40 mg, and 1 × unknown
dose), one mirtazapine (dose unknown) and one sertraline (100 mg). The specific treatments
offered by OASIS have been detailed elsewhere (Fusar-Poli  et al. 
 2015 ). All subjects were managed in the
community, attending regular out-patient appointments. A total of 15 HCs from the same geographical area were recruited via local
advertisements. Absence of psychiatric illness history was confirmed with the Mini
International Neuropsychiatric Inventory (Sheehan  et al. 
 1998 ). None of the HC subjects had a history of
neurological illness, or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th
edition (DSM-IV) drug or alcohol dependence (American Psychiatric Association,  2013 ). All subjects provided informed written consent
to participate and the study was approved by the local National Health Service Research
Ethics Committee. The SAT The SAT has been previously described in detail elsewhere (Roiser  et al. 
 2009 ,  2010 ). In brief, the SAT is a speeded-response game, rewarded with money, which
measures responses to cue features, which can be either task-relevant or task-irrelevant.
On each trial of the task, participants were required to respond to a briefly presented
square. Before the square appeared, a cue was shown indicating the likelihood of obtaining
a reward for the forthcoming response. Participants received a monetary reward on 50% of
trials, with more money awarded for faster responses. The cues varied in two different
visual dimensions; colour (red or blue) and shape (animals or household objects). One of
these cue dimensions was task-relevant and the other task-irrelevant. One task-relevant
feature was highly associated with receiving a reward, with 87.5% of these trial types
rewarded (e.g. blue stimuli). The other task-relevant dimension (e.g. red stimuli) was not
rewarded on any trials. For the task-irrelevant dimension, an equal proportion of both
features (e.g. animal and household stimuli) was rewarded. Participants were not informed
about these contingencies, which remained the same over the two blocks of 64 trials within
a testing session, and instead had to learn them over successive trials of the task. To
avoid practice effects between baseline and follow-up, four different versions of the task
were used, counterbalanced across participants, each with a different stimulus feature
(blue, red, animal or household) rewarded with high probability. Participants performed the task on two occasions, while being scanned using functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The baseline assessment was performed at the time of
clinical presentation. The follow-up assessment was carried out approximately 17 months
later. On each visit they performed the same version of the task twice. The SAT provides
behavioural measures of adaptive (relevant) and aberrant (irrelevant) motivational
salience on the basis of reaction times (RTs: implicit salience) and visual analogue scale
(VAS) ratings from 0 to 100% (explicit salience). Implicit adaptive salience is defined as
the speeding of responses on high- relative to low-probability reward trials. Explicit
adaptive salience is defined as the increase in VAS ratings on high- relative to
low-probability reward trials. Implicit aberrant salience and explicit aberrant salience
are defined as the absolute difference in RT and VAS ratings, respectively, between the
two levels of the task-irrelevant stimulus dimension (Roiser  et al. 
 2009 ). Behavioural analysis Behavioural scores on the SAT were analysed using a repeated-measures analysis of
variance (ANOVA) with time as within-subject and group as between-subject factors and
years of education as a covariate. To test for group differences at baseline and follow-up
separately, univariate ANOVA with education as covariate was used. Using box-and-whisker
plots on each SAT measure for both groups separately, two HCs and two UHR subjects were
excluded as outliers. fMRI data acquisition and analysis Scanning was performed on a whole-body 3 T MRI General Electric (USA) system. During each
of the four scanning runs (two per day), we acquired T2*-weighted echo-planar images
(EPIs) with the following parameters: 50 axial slices (sequential and top-down
acquisition) of 2.4 mm thickness, 2.7 mm interslice gap, field of view 240 mm 2 
and matrix size 64 × 64. The repetition time was 2.5 s and the echo time 25 ms. A total of
237 image volumes were acquired in a single functional run. EPIs were analysed using an event-related design with SPM12 ( www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm ). Pre-processing was performed for each subject and
time point separately. In brief, slice-timing correction was first performed on each
volume using the middle slice as the reference. The images were then realigned to the
first image in the series (following removal of dummy scans), spatially normalized to the
Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm
full half-width maximum (FWHM). All images underwent visual inspection and participants
with a high number of severely corrupted images and/or gross artefacts were excluded (two
HCs and one UHR). Additionally, all images were checked for movement artefacts, and all
scans with more than 5 mm deviation from the previous scan in any dimension, resulting in
corrupted volumes, were excluded and replaced with the average of the neighbouring volumes
(5.1% in HCs and 1.5% in UHRs). Subjects with more than 10% corrupted volumes were
excluded (two UHRs). In the final sample of 23 UHR subjects, 19 subjects were included
based on BLIPS, three based on BLIPS and one based on APS + GRD. Voxel-wise maximum likelihood parameter estimates were calculated during the first-level
analysis using the general linear model. Our design matrix included an autoregressive
AR(1) model of serial correlations and a high-pass filter with a cut-off of 128 s. The
onsets of each event were convolved with the SPM synthetic haemodynamic response function.
In this model, we included four ‘cue’ regressors, representing the different cue types and
an ‘outcome’ regressor representing the time points when reward feedback was provided
during the task. Cues on which participants failed to respond entirely were excluded from
the analysis (regressor of no interest) due to the possibility that participants were not
attending during the trial. Eight contrast images were generated per participant: adaptive
and aberrant reward prediction at baseline and follow-up separately; average images over
both visits for adaptive and aberrant reward prediction (to test for main effect of
group); and two images subtracting the contrast vector of baseline from follow-up (to test
for the main effect of time and time x group interaction). Adaptive reward prediction
contrasts were defined as: high-probability reward cue features minus low-probability
reward cue features across the task-relevant dimension. Aberrant reward prediction
contrasts were defined as subjective ‘high-probability’ reward cue features minus
subjective ‘low-probability’ reward cue features (based on the subject's VAS ratings for
that run) across the task-irrelevant dimension (Roiser  et al. 
 2010 ). Two-sample tests were conducted at the second level to test for group effects at baseline
and follow-up separately, as well as to test for main effects of group and time and for
time x group interactions. Significance was assessed at a cluster-level threshold of
 p  < 0.05 family-wise error (FWE) corrected across the whole
brain, using an uncorrected cluster-forming threshold of  p  < 0.001
(Petersson  et al. 
 1999 ; Woo  et al. 
 2014 ) with an extent threshold of 20 voxels. We
also focused our analysis on the VS as this was part of our primary hypothesis, using a
voxel-level approach. The VS region of interest was defined using coordinates taken from a
previous SAT fMRI study in an independent UHR cohort (Roiser  et al. 
 2013 ): right ( x  = 12;
 y  = 12;  z  = −3) and left ( x  = −12;
 y  = 9;  z  = −3). Small volume correction was applied
for this analysis using 15 mm spheres around these coordinates (Roiser  et al. 
 2013 ) and a voxel-level threshold of
 p  < 0.05 FWE corrected was considered significant. As groups
differed in years of education, this variable was added as a covariate in the second-level
model. Relationships between brain activation, behaviour and symptoms Relationships between neural responses and behavioural and clinical features were
identified by including outcome measures from the SAT, CAARMS and Global Assessment of
Functioning (GAF) as covariates in second-level models. The same procedure for correction
for multiple comparisons as described above was employed. Relationships between
behavioural salience responses and symptomatology in UHR subjects were tested with
Pearson's correlation coefficients using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
(SPSS 16, SPSS Inc., USA). Results Demographical and clinical features The two groups did not differ in age, gender, handedness, intelligence quotient or
cigarette, alcohol, cannabis and cocaine consumption, but HCs had more years of education
(therefore, all group comparisons were covaried for years of education). At baseline, UHR
subjects had higher scores on CAARMS positive and negative symptoms and lower scores on
the GAF. Over time, the UHR group showed significant improvements in CAARMS positive and
negative symptoms, but not in GAF scores ( Table
1 ).  Table 1. Demographical and clinical characteristics of the study sample Healthy controls

than HC subjects ( F 1,34  = 6.718,
 p  = 0.014), and there was a trend for a group × time interaction
( F 1,34  = 3.225,  p  = 0.081). There was
also a trend for a group × time interaction for explicit aberrant salience
( F 1,34  = 3.325,  p  = 0.077). Based on our
 a priori  hypotheses we constructed linear contrasts at each time
point to test for the predicted group differences in aberrant salience. At baseline, UHR subjects were more likely than HCs to attribute salience to irrelevant
cue features (explicit aberrant salience) ( F 1,34  = 4.732,
 p  = 0.037), but did not exhibit greater implicit aberrant salience
than HCs ( F 1,34  = 0.964,  p  = 0.333). At
follow-up the group difference in explicit aberrant salience was no longer significant
( F 1,34  = 0.061,  p  = 0.806), but HCs had
significantly lower implicit aberrant scores than the UHR group
( F 1,34  = 12.296,  p  = 0.001) due to a
reduction in this measure over time ( Figs.
1 a  and  
 b 
 ).  Fig. 1. ( a ) Implicit (reaction times, ms) and ( b )
explicit (visual analogue scale) scores for aberrant motivational salience
processing in healthy controls and subjects at ultra-high risk (UHR) for
psychosis. Values are means, with standard errors represented by vertical
bars. Within the UHR group we detected no significant correlations between aberrant salience
responses and psychotic symptoms (baseline, follow-up, change over time). Adaptive attribution of salience Across both visits, the UHR group had lower implicit adaptive salience scores than HCs
( F 1,34  = 11.472,  p  = 0.002), as well as
lower explicit adaptive salience scores ( F 1,34  = 5.493,
 p  = 0.035). There was also a significant group x time interaction for
explicit adaptive salience ( F 1,34  = 4.157,
 p  = 0.049). At baseline, UHR subjects had significantly lower implicit adaptive salience than HCs
( F 1,34  = 13.866,  p  = 0.001) and also
exhibited significantly lower explicit adaptive salience
( F 1,34  = 9.043,  p  = 0.005). Both of these
group differences were no longer significant at follow-up (implicit adaptive salience:
 F 1,34  = 3.733,  p  = 0.062; explicit
adaptive salience:  F 1,34  = 1.360,
 p  = 0.252), due to improved scores in the UHR group together with
relatively stable performance in HCs ( Figs.
2 a  and  
 b 
 ).  Fig. 2. ( a ) Implicit (reaction times, ms) and ( b )
explicit (visual analogue scale) scores for adaptive motivational salience

correlated with the severity of abnormal beliefs ( r  = −0.674,
 p  < 0.001) (online Supplementary Fig. S1A) and of positive
symptoms ( r  = −0.653,  p  < 0.001) (online
Supplementary Fig. S1B), and positively correlated with the level of global functioning
( r  = 0.497,  p  = 0.014) (online Supplementary Fig.
S1C). All behavioural results remained after excluding the UHR subject with a later
transition to psychosis (online Supplementary information 2A). Activation during salience processing Aberrant reward prediction There were no significant effects of group or time, and no group x time interactions.
There were also no significant group differences in responses to irrelevant cues at
either baseline or follow-up. Adaptive reward prediction Across both time points, UHR subjects showed less activation than HCs in the VS,
calcarine sulcus and midbrain bilaterally and in the left cuneus and middle temporal
gyrus (main effect of group:  Fig.
3 a , online Supplementary Table S1). Across both groups,
activation during adaptive reward prediction was greater at follow-up than at baseline
in the bilateral VS and right thalamus (main effect of time:  Fig. 3 b , online Supplementary Table S2). No
significant group × time interactions were found for adaptive reward prediction.  Fig. 3. ( a ) Greater activation during adaptive reward prediction in
healthy controls (HC) compared with ultra-high-risk (UHR) subjects across both

during adaptive reward prediction across both groups. Images are displayed at a
cluster-forming threshold of  p  < 0.001 uncorrected, with

values. At baseline, the UHR group showed significantly less activation than HCs in the VS
bilaterally and the left parahippocampal and middle temporal gyrus, and cerebellum
during adaptive reward prediction (online Supplementary Table S3). At follow-up, the UHR
group continued to show significantly less activation in the VS bilaterally (online
Supplementary Table S4). All results remained after excluding the UHR subject with a
later transition to psychosis (online Supplementary information S2B). There were no significant relationships between neural responses from the aberrant and
adaptive reward prediction contrast and behavioural scores on the SAT (baseline,
follow-up, change over time). Relationship between longitudinal changes in clinical features and brain activation Aberrant salience There were no significant relationships between changes in clinical features and
longitudinal changes in brain activation during aberrant reward prediction. Adaptive salience In the UHR group, there was a trend ( t 22  = 1.775,
 p  = 0.09) for the mean severity of abnormal beliefs to improve between
presentation and follow-up ( Fig.
4 a ). The degree of improvement in abnormal beliefs over time was
associated with the longitudinal increase in activation during adaptive reward
prediction in the right VS and in the supplementary motor cortex bilaterally ( Figs. 4 b  and  
 c 
 , online Supplementary Table S5). This relationship remained after excluding the
UHR subject with a later transition to psychosis (online Supplementary information S2B).

Scatterplot of negative relationship between change in right ventral striatum (VS)

( b ) and change in abnormal beliefs [Comprehensive Assessment of
At-Risk Mental States (CAARMS) item unusual thought content] from baseline to
follow-up in UHR subjects ( r  = −0.702). There were no significant correlations between longitudinal changes in negative
symptoms and in neural responses during motivational salience processing. Discussion To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal investigation of salience processing in
subjects with psychotic symptoms. We explored the relationship between changes in the
clinical features of people at UHR for psychosis after they had presented to clinical
services and longitudinal changes in their behavioural and neural responses during aberrant
and adaptive salience processing. Aberrant salience Consistent with the aberrant salience model (Heinz,  2002 ; Kapur,  2003 ; Howes &
Kapur,  2009 ), we found that UHR subjects were
more likely to attribute salience to irrelevant stimuli than HCs at clinical presentation.
These data are consistent with a previous report of increased explicit aberrant salience
in an independent UHR sample (Roiser  et al. 
 2013 ). A study using the SAT in first-episode
schizophrenia did not find a difference in the patient sample overall, but found that
aberrant salience was related to the severity of delusions and negative symptoms within
the patient group (Roiser  et al. 
 2009 ). However, it should be noted that another
study found no significant differences between UHR subjects, first-episode patients and
controls in aberrant salience attribution (Smieskova  et al. 
 2015 ). During the 17-month follow-up period, there was a reduction in explicit aberrant salience
in UHR subjects, such that there was no longer a significant group difference relative to
HCs. On the basis that abnormal salience processing is proposed to underlie the generation
of psychotic symptoms (Roiser  et al. 
 2009 ,  2013 ), we tested whether longitudinal changes in aberrant salience processing were
related to changes in clinical features in the UHR subjects during the follow-up period.
Although UHR subjects showed improvements clinically, there were no significant
correlations between changes in these variables and longitudinal changes in behavioural
measures of aberrant salience processing. It has been proposed that the link between
aberrant salience and symptoms is moderated by cognitive biases (Howes & Murray,
 2014 ), which may account for the lack of direct
relationship between aberrant salience and symptom change in our data. Adaptive salience The aberrant salience model proposed that adaptive salience is intact in patients with
psychosis, but may become impaired as a result of treatment with antipsychotic medication
(Heinz,  2002 ; Kapur,  2003 ). The first experimental study of salience processing in
first-episode psychosis using the SAT found that patients showed impaired adaptive
salience, and this was attributed to be an effect of antipsychotic treatment (Roiser
 et al. 
 2009 ). However, a subsequent study of largely
medication-naive UHR subjects also found a trend for reduced implicit adaptive salience
(Roiser  et al. 
 2013 ). In the present study, which involved a
larger patient sample, at presentation, UHR subjects showed significantly reduced adaptive
salience responses. As all of our UHR subjects were naive to antipsychotic medication at
this stage, these data not only suggest that adaptive salience is impaired in UHR
subjects, but that this is not secondary to antipsychotic treatment. Consistent with this
interpretation, a recent study found that adaptive salience processing was numerically
(though not significantly) impaired in first-episode psychosis patients, but this
impairment was if anything less marked in antipsychotic-treated than untreated patients
(Smieskova  et al. 
 2015 ). Although significant behavioural differences in adaptive salience processing were only
present at baseline, group differences in activation during adaptive salience processing
were seen at both presentation and follow-up time points. At both time points, UHR
subjects showed reduced activation relative to HCs in the VS. This is consistent with a
recent meta-analysis demonstrating reduced VS activity in response to reward-predicting
cues in schizophrenia spectrum disorders (Radua  et al. 
 2015 ), and reports of altered VS activation in
patients with psychosis during reward prediction error tasks (Murray  et al. 
 2008 ; Gradin  et al. 
 2011 ). Furthermore, within the UHR group,
improvement in abnormal beliefs over the follow-up period was correlated with the degree
to which VS activation increased over time during adaptive reward prediction. This finding
is in line with data from unmedicated first-episode patients demonstrating a negative
correlation between the severity of delusional symptoms and reward prediction signals in
the VS (Esslinger  et al. 
 2012 ). Taken with longitudinal positron emission
tomography imaging findings that changes in dopamine synthesis capacity in the dorsal
(associative) striatum are associated with change in clinical state (Howes  et al. 
 2011 a ), our findings suggest
that alterations in both the VS and dorsal striatum are linked to symptom change. A
possible mechanism could be that hyperactive inputs from the hippocampus to the VS in
psychosis may have an impact on dopaminergic neurons that project to more dorsal
(associative) striatal areas and thereby affect dorsal striatum-related salience
processing (Haber,  2003 ; Lodge & Grace,
 2011 ,  2012 ; Modinos  et al. 
 2015 ). The amelioration of abnormal beliefs in UHR subjects was also associated with
longitudinal increases in activation in the supplementary motor cortex to reward
predicting cue features. The latter finding was not predicted, as the supplementary motor
cortex is not specifically implicated in motivational salience processing. However, the
SAT is a complex task that also involves sustained attention, maintaining stimulus
information in memory, decision-making and response selection (Roiser  et al. 
 2013 ), and the UHR state is associated with a
broad range of cognitive impairments (Fusar-Poli  et al. 
 2012 ). We therefore speculate that this finding
in the supplementary motor cortex may be related to alterations in one or more of these
processes, possibly secondary to changes in striatal function. Furthermore, UHR subjects
also showed reduced activation in the calcarine sulcus, cuneus, midbrain and middle
temporal gyrus across both visits during the attribution of salience to relevant stimuli,
as well as reduced activation in the parahippocampal gyrus, cerebellum, midbrain, middle
temporal gyrus, middle and anterior cingulate cortex, inferior frontal gyrus and insula at
baseline and/or follow-up (see online Supplementary information S1 and S2B for more
details). Together with the striatum, integration of these regions is important to sustain
emotion and cognition, especially during the detection and processing of salient
information (Seeley  et al. 
 2007 ; Menon & Uddin,  2010 ). Dysfunction of this network and abnormal
network switching when dealing with a relevant task at hand has been proposed to underlie
the formation of psychotic symptoms (Palaniyappan & Liddle,  2012 ; Palaniyappan  et al. 
 2013 ; Schmidt  et al. 
 2016 ). Some limitations of our study merit comment. The sample sizes were modest, largely
because inclusion required that participants completed multi-modal neuroimaging
assessments at both baseline and follow-up. The modest group sizes may thus have accounted
for the absence of significant group differences in activation during aberrant salience
processing. A further consideration is that at the time of writing, only one UHR subject
had developed a psychotic disorder (all results remained after excluding this subject; see
Supplementary information S2A and B for details), precluding any examination of the
relationship between abnormal salience processing and the risk of transition to psychosis.
In this regard, it is possible that the low conversion rate in our UHR sample may explain
the lack of alterations in brain activation during aberrant salience processing. Future
large-scale studies with a meaningful ratio between converters and non-converters are
required to test if functional brain alterations during aberrant reward prediction are
evident in UHR subjects who later develop psychosis or if the risk of transition to
psychosis is more related to impaired activation when dealing with a relevant task at hand
(i.e. adaptive reward prediction). Furthermore, in accordance with the aberrant salience
model (Kapur,  2003 ), the SAT has been designed to
measure abnormal motivational (reward) salience processing in psychosis and its relation
to dopamine dysregulation in the VS. However, motivation is not the only form of salience
(Winton-Brown  et al. 
 2014 ), and it would be important to test ventral
and dorsal (associative) striatal activation in psychosis during other forms of salience
processing that are not measured using speeded response tasks. Finally, subsequent to
presentation, some of the UHR subjects received CBT or low doses of antidepressants, which
may have influenced our findings. In this study, the numbers of subjects receiving
different forms of treatment were too small to allow for meaningful subgroup analyses and
this issue would be better addressed in longitudinal studies that were explicitly linked
to a clinical trial of an intervention that might be expected to improve motivational
salience processing. In summary, this study shows that UHR subjects exhibit behavioural deficits in both
adaptive and aberrant salience processing at clinical presentation, which disappeared
along with the remission of APS over the follow-up period. Our results further indicate VS
hypoactivation in UHR subjects during adaptive reward prediction at baseline and follow-up
and that the amelioration of abnormal beliefs over the follow-up period is linked to a
longitudinal increase in VS activation during adaptive reward prediction. Acknowledgements This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant no. P2ZHP3_155184
