 Introduction 
 Aesthetic evaluations, such as judging beauty and attractiveness, play an important
role in our lives, affecting (for example) whom we choose to marry and where we would prefer
to live. We can perform aesthetic evaluations on a wide variety of stimuli – a face
can be beautiful or ugly, as can a house, room, or landscape. This suggests the possibility
that a common evaluative signal might underlie different aesthetic judgments, analogous to
the common signal that is believed to underlie different kinds of economic judgments.
However, a counterargument is the fact that aesthetic judgments are rarely made across
stimulus category (“Is this face more beautiful than this landscape?”). This
makes them different from economic judgments, which usually involve comparison across
disparate categories of goods, and suggests that a “common currency” for
value might not be useful—or calculated—in the aesthetic domain. 
 Here we test whether human prefrontal cortex computes a common currency for value
that is used for aesthetic judgments. Previous studies have shown that fMRI response in
ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) during economic decision-making corresponds to the
“utility” or “subjective value” of a stimulus ( Bartra, McGuire, and Kable 2013 ). This response exhibits
some degree of domain-generality, insofar as it can be elicited by both money and consumer
goods ( Chib et al. 2009 ;  Kim et al. 2011 ;  Levy et al.
2011 ). However, the few studies that have attempted to compare non-economic (e.g.
social) to monetary rewards have produced contradictory findings, sometimes showing
overlapping activity in vmPFC and sometimes revealing non-overlapping activity or no
activity at all in this region (Smith et al. 2010;  Lin et
al. 2012 ,  Sescousse et al. 2010 ,  Izuma et al. 2008 ). It remains unclear whether a common
evaluative signal exists that could apply to judgments very far removed from economic
exchange such as aesthetic judgments. 
 To examine this issue, we scanned subjects with functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) while they made attractiveness judgments of faces and places. Our aim was to
identify a common neural signal of value that operates across these two very different
non-economic stimulus classes. By using faces and places as stimuli, we intended to give our
two categories the “best advantage” in terms of possible neural differences.
Beautiful faces and beautiful places are associated with distinct reward outcomes: beautiful
faces offer the promise of reproductive success and social advancement (see  Rhodes 2006  for a review), whereas beautiful landscapes
offer the promise of prospect/refuge, physical resources, and rest ( Appleton 1975 ;  White et al. 2010 ;
 Berman & Kaplan 2008 ). Faces and places also
differ substantially in their visual properties, to the extent that they are processed by
distinct regions of visual cortex ( Kanwisher et al.
1997 ;  Epstein and Kanwisher 1999 ). Face and
place attractiveness are not typically assigned monetary values (although it is not
impossible to assign monetary value to something without a market value - see Smith et al.
2010,  Mitchell and Carson 1989 ). Therefore, a common
response for face and place attractiveness is unlikely in the absence of a common
currency-type, domain-general evaluative neural signal. 
 Previous work has shown that activity in vmPFC correlates with face attractiveness
( O’Doherty et al. 2003 ;  Ishai 2007 ;  Cloutier et
al. 2008 ), though this is not always the case ( Chatterjee et al. 2009 ). A single study on the neural correlates of indoor place
attractiveness showed no activity in vmPFC that correlated with parametric beauty ratings
( Vartanian et al. 2013 ). Consequently, the question
of whether face and place attractiveness are represented in the same or different brain
regions remains open. To anticipate, our results suggest that there are both
category-general and category-specific representations of attractiveness in vmPFC, and a
signal specific to face attractiveness in lateral orbitofrontal cortex (latOFC). 
 
 
 Methods 
 
 Subjects 
 34 healthy, right-handed volunteers with normal or corrected-to-normal vision
were recruited to participate in the fMRI study. All subjects gave written informed
consent according to procedures approved by the University of Pennsylvania institutional
review board. One subject was excluded due to an incidental finding, two subjects were
excluded due to technical issues with their anatomical images, and three subjects were
excluded due to excessive motion in the scanner. This left us with 28 subjects whose
functional data were analyzed (14 females, mean age 22.5). 
 
 
 fMRI Acquisition 
 Scans were performed at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania on a 3T
Siemens Trio scanner equipped with a Siemens body coil and a 32-channel head coil. High
resolution T1-weighted anatomical images were acquired using a 3D MPRAGE pulse sequence
(TR = 1620 ms, TE = 3 ms, TI = 950 ms, voxel size = 0.9766 × 0.9766 × 1
mm, matrix size = 192 × 256 × 160). T2*-weighted images sensitive to blood
oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrasts were acquired using a gradient-echo
echo-planar pulse sequence (TR = 3000 ms, TE = 30 ms, voxel size =
3×3×3mm, matrix size = 64 × 64, 46 axial slices). The slices were
tilted −30 degrees from the AC-PC plane to reduce signal dropout ( Deichmann et al. 2003 ). 
 
 
 Stimuli 
 Stimuli were digitized 400×400 pixel color photographs of 144 places and
144 faces chosen to span a wide range of attractiveness. The places were natural
environments with no man-made elements, spanning scene types such as swamps, mountain
ranges, beaches, fields, and forests. The face set had equal numbers of males and females,
and all faces were Caucasian, upright and forward-facing, with neutral to pleasant
expressions, selected from the Glasgow Unfamiliar Face Database ( http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/m.burton/pages/gfmt/Glasgow%20Face%20Recognition%20Group.html ),
Radboud Database ( Langner et al. 2010 ), the Center
for Vital Longevity Face Database ( Minear & Park
2004 ), CVL Face Database (Peter Peer,  http://www.lrv.fri.uni-lj.si/facedb.html ), Diana Theater Face Database
(courtesy of Dr. Robert Schultz at the Center for Autism Research), and online searches.
Face images were extracted from their original background, blurred slightly along the
edges, cropped so that hair did not extend below the chin, and resized to span a height of
400 pixels. They were then placed on an abstract colored background created by
phase-scrambling a single place image. This ensured that they subtended the same visual
angle as the places while retaining a similar background color. A unique scrambling of the
background image was used for each face (code used from:  http://visionscience.com/pipermail/visionlist/2007/002181.html ). 
 These 288 stimuli were chosen from a larger set of 573 face and place images
based on pilot testing intended to ensure that they covered a wide range of
attractiveness, thus maximizing our ability to see neural activity related to this
variability. In these pilot tests, 10 subjects made Likert-scale ratings (1–8) of
the visual attractiveness of each place and face. Images were blocked by category
(face/place) and subjects used the keyboard to make ratings at their own pace, with
instructions to spread their judgments across the whole 1–8 range. Each
subjects’ ratings were then z-scored across all images and these z-scores were
averaged across subjects for each image. The images were then divided into
“low”, “average”, and “high”
attractiveness bins according to whether they had a z-score below −0.5 (low),
between −0.5 and 0.5 (average), or above 0.5 (high). Images were then chosen in
equal numbers from these three attractiveness bins to make the final stimulus set. 
 
 
 Design and Procedure 
 The fMRI experiment consisted of six 4 min 57 sec scan runs, each of which was
divided into two 36-s face blocks, two 36-s place blocks, and two 36-s fixation (or
“rest”) blocks in which subjects passively fixated on a central crosshair
( Figure 1 ). Between each block was an additional 9
seconds of passive fixation. 18 seconds of fixation were added at the beginning and end of
each run to allow the T2* signal to reach a steady state and to model the final HRF,
respectively. During each face and place block, subjects used a button box to give
“low”, ”average”, or “high” attractiveness
ratings to 12 faces or places, each presented for 1 s followed by a 2 s interstimulus
interval (ISI) during which only a crosshair was on the screen. Subjects made their
ratings any time within the 3-second trial; button assignment was counterbalanced across
subjects. Blocks were ordered such that no block type repeated twice in a row (including
fixation blocks), and the block orders were counterbalanced across runs. 
 To acclimate subjects to the distribution of attractiveness in the stimulus set,
they were asked to rate prior to the scan the attractiveness of 24 faces and 24 places not
used in the main experiment on a 1–8 scale. These 48 images were chosen to span
the entire range of attractiveness found in the main stimulus set. In addition,
immediately after the scan session, subjects were presented with the images from the main
experiment again in a random order and asked to rate them on the same 1–8 scale.
These post-scan ratings were used in the subsequent fMRI analysis because they provided a
finer-grained measure of face and place attractiveness than the high/average/low ratings
made in the scanner. 
 Experiment trials within blocks were ordered such that the place and face
attractiveness regressors used in the subsequent analyses would have maximal power to
detect variability in fMRI response. Although these regressors were ultimately based on
the attractiveness judgments made by the subjects in the scanner, which could not be known
in advance, we were able to obtain a rough estimate of their shape by using the
high/average/low attractiveness ratings provided by the pilot subjects. We generated
10,000 random orders of face and place stimuli that fit our experimental design, convolved
the corresponding attractiveness ratings with a canonical hemodynamic response function
(HRF), and determined the power by calculating the ratio of variance before and after
convolution. A “best” sequence of attractiveness levels was chosen (the
one with the highest power), and images corresponding to these bins were drawn randomly
from the stimulus set to create a unique stimulus sequence for each subject. 
 
 
 fMRI Data Analysis 
 Pre-processing and data analysis for individual subjects was performed using the
FMRIB Software Library (FSL v.4.1.6) ( Jenkinson et al.
2012 ). Functional images were corrected for differences in slice time acquisition
and then de-obliqued to correct for the 30 degree tilt slice acquisition. For each run,
the first six volumes were removed to account for the fMRI signal not yet reaching
steady-state, and data were then motion corrected by spatially realigning each image with
the central image in the run, registered to the subject-specific T1-weighted image using 6
degrees of freedom rigid-body transformations, and high-pass filtered to remove temporal
frequencies below 0.0074 Hertz. 
 After preprocessing, we performed both univariate and multivariate pattern
analyses on the data, as described below. An overview of the analysis scheme is provided
in  Figure 2 . 
 
 
 Univariate Analyses 
 General linear modeling was used to estimate neural activity correlated with
subject-specific ratings of face and place attractiveness. Each subjects’
post-scan 1–8 ratings were used to create parametric regressors for face and place
attractiveness which extended across all six experimental scans. The model also included
regressors corresponding to face and place in-scan reaction times (RTs), as our behavioral
data revealed that reaction time was significantly negatively correlated with place
attractiveness (but not face attractiveness). We did not include quadratic regressors for
face and place attractiveness, in contrast to previous studies (e.g.  Winston et al. 2007 ), because these quadratic regressors were strongly
negatively correlated with RT. Finally, categorical regressors were added for face trials,
place trials, and instruction screens, and nuisance regressors were added to account for
between-scan variability and outliers (outliers calculated with the Gabrieli Lab’s
Artifact Detection Tools:  http://www.nitrc.org/projects/artifact_detect/ ). All regressors, except scan
indicators, were convolved with a canonical HRF. 
 We used this model to perform two sets of analyses. The first was a set of
targeted analyses focusing on regions in the frontal lobe that have been previously
implicated in the processing of information about stimulus value. The second was a
whole-brain random effects analysis intended to find areas responding to face and place
attractiveness without any  a priori  hypotheses about where these areas
would be. For the targeted frontal lobe analyses, unsmoothed parameter estimates from the
contrasts of interest were registered to the cortical surface using surface templates
derived from each subject’s T1-weighted anatomical image using
Freesurfer’s segementation function (recon-all). The data were then averaged
across subjects by spherically registering these subject-specific surfaces to the group
brain (an average of the subject-specific surfaces, where vertex coordinates are
calculated as the average tailarach coordinates of that vertex across subjects). During
this registration process the data was smoothed on the group-average surface at 3mm FWHM.
Using the unfolded cortical surface for inter-subject registration in this manner reduces
the variability when averaging across volumetric data associated with regions containing
highly variable cortical folding patterns, which was especially important in this case
because orbitofrontal cortex is known to have a high degree of anatomical variability
between subjects ( Chiavaras & Petrides 2000 ;
 Chiavaras et al. 2001 ). Random-effects analyses
were then performed on the contrasts of interest to identify regions within vmPFC and
latOFC that responded to face and place attractiveness. Output was cluster-corrected for
small-volumes in vmPFC and latOFC and Bonferroni corrected to account for observations
across 2 hemispheres (clusters defined at p<0.05 uncorrected and then permutation
corrected to p<0.05 using Freesurfer’s simulation function to estimate the
distribution of maximum cluster sizes under the null hypothesis). The medial surface
 a priori  small volume was defined using a functional mask for vmPFC
( Bartra, McGuire, & Kable 2013 ) which we
translated into surface space. As there is some evidence of category-specific signals in
latOFC (e.g.  Sescousse et al. 2010 ), we also used
this area as an  a priori  small volume, defined by using the ventral
surface of the “lateralorbitofrontal” ROI from Freesurfer’s APARC
library (taken from the Desikan-Killiany atlas). 
 We performed a leave-one-subject-out iterative cross-validation analysis ( Kriegeskorte et al. 2009 , supplementary discussion) on
the significant clusters resulting from the targeted frontal lobe analysis to test whether
activity within any clusters responding to face attractiveness or place attractiveness
responded differentially to face versus place attractiveness. On each iteration, data from
a single subject was held out as the test set. Clusters within vmPFC and latOFC responding
to face or place attractiveness were then defined based on a group analysis of the
n−1 remaining subjects, using the procedures described above. The response in
these clusters in the nth subject was then analyzed, and the procedure repeated. This
method gave us an estimate of the response in each cluster to face and place
attractiveness, using independent data sets to define the boundary of the cluster and the
strength of the effect. 
 For the whole-brain analyses, pre-processed data were smoothed with a 5mm FWHM
kernel and parameter estimates for regressors of interest were obtained for each voxel for
each subject. These were normalized to standard volumetric MNI152 space using linear 12
degree of freedom transformations, resampled to 2×2×2 mm voxels in this
standard space, and submitted to group level random effects analyses for contrasts of
interest. The true Type 1 error rate for each contrast was calculated from FSL’s
randomise function using Monte-Carlo simulations that permuted the signs of wholebrain
data from individual subjects (10,000 relabelings; method based on  Freedman & Lane 1983 ). The resulting reported voxels are
significant at p<0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons across the whole
brain. 
 We also performed a follow-up analysis which examined response in functional
ROIs in visual cortex. Because we did not conduct independent localizer scans for all
subjects, these ROIs were defined by using a set of 40 subjects’ localizer
contrast files (19 which came from our current study). These group-defined
“parcels” were created using an algorithmic method which is fully
described in  Julian et al. (2012)  (We diverged from
the Julian et al. description in that we chose a more liberal threshold of p<0.001
for the Face>Objects contrast maps.) Parcels were defined using the contrasts
Faces>Objects (fusiform face area, FFA), Scenes>Objects (parahippocampal
place area, PPA), Objects>Scrambled Objects (posterior lateral occipital cortex,
LOC) Scrambled Objects > Objects (early visual cortex, EVC). For the ROI analysis,
we then translated individual subject contrast maps for face and place attractiveness into
standard space and extracted parameter estimates for each subject within these
group-defined ROIs. 
 
 
 Pattern Analysis 
 Our univariate analyses revealed clusters of activity in vmPFC that responded
similarly to both face and place attractiveness. To further examine whether there were any
differences between the signals for face and place attractiveness in vmPFC, we used a
pattern classification analysis to test whether  patterns  of response
rather than overall  mean  response within these clusters might reflect
category-specific attractiveness information. Using well-established methods ( Haxby et al., 2001 ), we split the data into independent
halves (each consisting of 3 of the 6 scan runs), identified activity patterns for face
and place attractiveness in each half, and then compared these patterns across halves to
establish their reliability and distinguishability. Activity patterns in each half were
calculated based on the same general linear model described above, except that the
regressors spanned 3 scans instead of 6. The resulting unsmoothed maps were then
registered to the group-defined surface-space, which allowed us to perform the
classification analysis within the same independently defined, leave-one-subject-out vmPFC
clusters that were used in our univariate analysis. Parameter estimates (beta values) were
extracted for each subject’s 4 independently defined vmPFC clusters, and
classification was run iteratively over all possible split halves of the data (10 ways in
which 6 scans can be split into two groups of 3). Classification was considered successful
if the average Pearson correlation between the face attractiveness patterns (or place
attractiveness patterns) in opposite halves of the data (within-category comparison) was
greater than the correlation between face and place attractiveness patterns in opposite
halves of the data (cross-category comparison) ( Haxby et
al. 2001 ). Raw correlation difference scores on which classification accuracy was
based (e.g. face to face – face to place) were also calculated. Both the accuracy
and correlation difference scores were then compared to chance (50%) and zero,
respectively, to determine if category-specific information was present in any of the
vmPFC clusters. 
 
 
 
 Results 
 
 Behavioral Results 
 Within-scan ratings of face and place attractiveness were strongly correlated
with post-scan ratings (Pearson’s r averaged across subjects for faces = 0.74,
t(27)=45.04, p<0.0001 and for places = 0.71, t(27)=35.17, p<0.0001;
p-values reflect repeated-measures t-tests on correlation scores), and there was no
significant difference between categories regarding the degree of correlation between
these within-scan and post-scan ratings (repeated-measures t-test on the difference
between correlation scores: t(27)=−1.4, p=0.17). Post-scan ratings for face and
place attractiveness showed extremely high levels of consistency across subjects
(Cronbach’s alpha for faces: 0.958; places: 0.956). The within- and
between-subjects consistency of attractiveness ratings confirms the validity of using the
finer-scale post-scan ratings to analyze the fMRI response. 
 Subject-specific means of face and place attractiveness ratings were not
significantly different, although there was a trend for places to have higher mean ratings
than faces (t(27)=1.94, p=0.06).  Figure 3a  displays
histograms of post-scan face and place attractiveness ratings. Post-scan ratings for
places were significantly negatively correlated with in-scan response times
(Pearson’s r averaged across subjects = −0.24, repeated-measures t-test on
correlation scores: t(27)=−9.07, p<0.0001). In contrast, there was no
significant correlation between post-scan face ratings and in-scan response times
(r=−0.01, t(27)= −0.27, p=0.79). By plotting response time as a function
of attractiveness, visual inspection revealed that rather than a linear function, RT
exhibited an inverted-U shaped relationship with both face and place attractiveness,
peaking in the center range of attractiveness ( Figure
3b ). RTs for face judgments were highly symmetrical around the mean, and
therefore were not correlated with face attractiveness ratings, whereas RTs for place
judgments had an elongated linear slope for the upper half of the attractiveness scale.
For each item, we also calculated the mean RT and the standard deviation of rating
judgments across subjects. These measures were moderately correlated for both face and
place stimuli (Pearson’s r for face stimuli: 0.43, and place stimuli: 0.57). In
other words, RTs were slower when there was greater disagreement among subjects about the
rating of an image, suggesting that RT may in part reflect the degree to which a subject
is uncertain about their rating. 
 
 
 Activity for face and place attractiveness in frontal cortex 
 We then turned to the primary question of interest: whether there was overlap
between regions responding to face and place attractiveness in the frontal lobes. To
answer this, we looked for effects of place and face attractiveness within frontal regions
known  a priori  to exhibit subjective value signals: ventromedial
prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (latOFC). We conducted the
analyses in surface-space to better account for the large variability in cortical folding
patterns along the ventral surface of frontal cortex. We focused on two (non-overlapping)
regions. 
 Our vmPFC ROI was functionally-defined based on Barta and colleagues’
meta-analysis of subjective value responses in the brain ( Bartra, McGuire, & Kable 2013 ). Within this ROI, we observed clusters
that responded linearly to face attractiveness at p<0.05 (corrected for small
volumes) in both hemispheres (“LvmPFC-face” and
“RvmPFC-face”; see  Table 1  and
 Figure 4 ) and clusters that responded linearly to
place attractiveness in both hemispheres (“LvmPFC-place” and
“RvmPFC-place”). Visual inspection makes clear that there is a great
degree of overlap between the face and place clusters in each hemisphere. The face
attractiveness clusters were found in similar locations to activity correlated with face
attractiveness in previous studies (e.g.  O’Doherty
et al. 2003 ,  Ishai et al. 2007 ;  Cloutier et al. 2008 ) ( Figure 4 ). 
 To assess whether any of these clusters responded selectively to attractiveness
for a single stimulus category, we performed a cross-validation analysis in which we
iteratively defined the clusters on n−1 subjects and then extracted parameter
estimates for the “left-out” subject. This provides a stringent test of
whether a cluster responded to both kinds of attractiveness: although each cluster was
defined based on its response to either face or place attractiveness, it was tested for
its response to the other category in an independent data set. Repeated-measures t-tests
comparing face to place attractiveness revealed that all vmPFC clusters showed a
significant response to both face and place attractiveness (LvmPFC-place response to face
att. t(27)=2.11, p=0.04, response to place att. t(27)=4.09, p=0.0004; LvmPFC-face response
to face att. t(27)=4.19, p=0.0003, response to place att. t(27)=3.70, p=0.001;
RvmPFC-place response to face att. t(27)=3.36, p=0.002, response to place att. t(27)=3.60,
p=0.001; RvmPFC-face response to face att. t(27)= 4.17, p=0.0003, response to place att.
t(27)=2.18, p=0.04; statistics obtained by t-tests comparing extracted mean parameter
estimates against zero). Importantly, all clusters were equally sensitive to both face and
place attractiveness regardless of how they were initially defined (Face attractiveness
> place attractiveness: LvmPFC-face t(27)=0.09, p=0.93, RvmPFC-face t(27)=1.04,
p=0.30, LvmPFC-place t(27)=−1.39, p=0.18, RvmPFC-place t(27)= −0.34,
p=0.73, all n.s., see  Figure 4 ; all statistics were
obtained by repeated-measures t-tests comparing extracted mean parameter estimates across
categories.) These results suggest that vmPFC responds similarly to variation in
attractiveness for these two categories; that is, clusters in vmPFC sensitive to face
attractiveness are also sensitive to place attractiveness, and vice-versa. Note that this
is the case even though the overall response in these regions was greater to faces than to
places (Faces > places in LvmPFC-face t(27)=3.51, p=0.002, RvmPFC-face t(27)=4.52,
p=0.0001; LvmPFC-place t(27)=4.44, p=0.0001, RvmPFC-place t(27)=3.18, p=0.004). 
 Our second region of interest was the lateral orbital-frontal cortex (latOFC).
This region has been implicated in subjective value representation of distinct categories
of reward (e.g.  Sescousse et al. 2010 ), though
value-based response is observed here less frequently than in vmPFC. Our analysis revealed
a cluster in the right hemisphere whose response correlated with face attractiveness
(p<0.05 cluster-wise permutation corrected for small-volumes, see  Table 1  and  Figure
4 ). We again used the cross-validation analysis to determine whether the
attractiveness response in this cluster was category-specific. A repeated-measures t-test
found significantly higher response for face attractiveness compared to place
attractiveness (t(25)=2.64, p=0.01). Indeed, place attractiveness response in the cluster
was not significantly different from zero (t-test, t(25)=−0.46, p=0.65). Of note,
the overall response to faces and places did not differ in this region (t(25)=0.08,
p=0.94). 
 
 
 Distributed category-specific encoding in vmPFC 
 Our univariate analyses revealed that clusters in vmPFC that have significant
mean response to one category of attractiveness also have a significant mean response to
the other category, and that the strength of these responses are not significantly
different from each other. While these results are in line with the “common
currency” hypothesis for evaluative signals in vmPFC, it remains possible that
these brain regions contain separate but intermixed valuation mechanisms for faces and
places, which were not discriminable when responses were averaged over all voxel in the
cluster. For example,  Kahnt et al. (2010)  showed
that high and low rewards could be classified during reward anticipation, even though
there was no significant difference in mean response between the two conditions. We tested
for a similar possibility by measuring vertex-wise activation patterns for face and place
attractiveness in separate halves of the data within each vmPFC cluster and examining
whether we could classify face vs. place attractiveness across the split. Classification
accuracy for the right hemisphere cluster defined by place attractiveness (RvmPFC-place)
was above chance (accuracy = 58%, t(27)=2.63, p=0.014; see  Figure 5 ). Accuracy in this cluster was similar for both categories,
though within-place accuracy was just above the threshold for significance (face-face vs.
face-place = 58%, t(27)=2.5, p=0.02; place-place vs. face-place = 58%,
t(27)=2.0, p=0.055). RvmPFC-face also showed a trend toward significant classification
(accuracy = 55.8%, t(27)=1.9, p=0.068) though neither individual category was
significant on its own (face-face vs. face-place = 55.9%, t(27)=1.66, p=0.11;
face-face vs. face-place = 55.7%, t(27)=1.55, p=0.13). Given the fact that
RvmPFC-face overlaps to a large degree with RvmPFC-place (see  Figure 4 ) but it also extends further anterior, these results suggest
that the locus of category-specific information is centered within the RvmPFC-place.
Accuracy was not significant for LvmPFC-place (accuracy = 50.3%, t(27)=0.1,
p=0.92) or LvmPFC-face (accuracy = 46.1%, t(27)=−1.33, p=0.20). We also
examined the raw correlation scores themselves (upon which the accuracy measures were
made) by calculating the difference scores between within- and cross-category Pearson
correlations. These difference scores were significantly different from zero only within
the same RvmPFC-place cluster that showed significant place vs. face attractiveness
classification (face/face – face/place difference score=0.08, t(27)=2.08, p=0.05;
place/place – face/place difference score=0.08, t(27)=2.25, p=0.03). 
 To observe the focal point of pattern classification without using predefined
clusters, we also performed a searchlight analysis, meaning that, for every vertex on the
cortical surface, we centered a 7mm radius disc around that vertex and performed the same
classification analysis. Within the vmPFC, peak correlation scores for both face and place
attractiveness (face-face vs. face-place; place-place vs. face-place) were located close
to the RvmPFC-place cluster but slightly more posterior (peak coordinates for face-face
vs. face-place: 5.6, 19.4, −7.6; peak coordinates for place-place vs. face-place:
5.7, 17.3, −7.9. Analysis and coordinates are derived from fsaverage/MNI305
space). These searchlight results reinforce the finding that it is a ventral and posterior
portion of vmPFC that contains category-specific information; the univariate-derived
cluster appears to be picking up on the more anterior portion of this region. 
 
 
 Whole brain analysis 
 We next looked for regions whose response correlated with face attractiveness
and place attractiveness outside of our  a priori  regions in frontal
cortex. We observed bilateral response in fusiform gyrus that was positively correlated
with face attractiveness, as well as a response in right intraparietal sulcus (See  Table 2 ). In contrast, no attractiveness-related
activity for places survived wholebrain corrections, though we observed sub-threshold
activity in posterior cingulate, ventral striatum, vmPFC, and in the region of
parahippocampus gyrus/collateral sulcus/hippocampus (p<0.001 uncorrected). In a
direct contrast of face attractiveness vs. place attractiveness, no voxels survived
wholebrain corrections. 
 To explore whether the areas that responded to face and place attractiveness
overlapped with face- and place-selective visual regions that have been previously
identified in occipitotemporal cortex, we conducted an ROI analysis using independently
defined ROIs for fusiform face area (FFA), parahippocampal place area (PPA), a posterior
object-selective region (LOC), and early visual cortex (EVC). Somewhat surprisingly, face
attractiveness was positively correlated with activity in all higher level regions (right
FFA: t(27)=2.9, p=0.007, left FFA: t(27)=2.2, p=0.037; right PPA: t(27)=3.8, p=0.0008,
left PPA: t(27)=2.5, p=0.017; right LOC: t(27)=3.37, p=0.002, left LOC: t(27)=3.05,
p=0.005) while place attractiveness only showed positively correlated activity within
right LOC (t(27)=2.1, p=0.04). Correlations between place attractiveness and fMRI response
were nonsignificant for right FFA (t(27)=0.8, p=0.41), left FFA (t(27)=0.7, p=0.46), right
PPA (t(27)=0.35, p=0.73), and left PPA (t(27)=0.00, p=0.997). Neither face nor place
attractiveness was significantly correlated with activity in EVC.  Figure 6  shows the location of the functional ROIs and activity related
to face and place attractiveness in visual regions. 
 Finally, for completeness, we compared categorical differences in activity
between face and place trials (irrespective of attractiveness). We observed significantly
greater response during place compared to face trials in regions previously reported to
respond preferentially to places and scenes (bilateral PPA, RSC, OPA/TOS). Conversely, we
observed significantly greater response during face compared to place trials in visual
regions previously reported to respond preferentially to faces (bilateral FFA, OFA), and
also in posterior cingulate, bilateral amygdala, vmPFC, and, surprisingly, a region of
right latOFC. ( Table 2  reports the MNI coordinates
of all significant clusters for this comparison.) Because we had also observed activation
in right latOFC for face attractiveness, we sought to determine whether the right latOFC
region defined by our face > place contrast also responded to face attractiveness.
We defined this region as an ROI, thresholded at t>3.5 on the group map, and
extracted the betas values from each subjects’ response to face attractiveness.
Unexpectedly, this region’s response was not significantly correlated with face
attractiveness (t(27) t=0.75 p=0.46).  Figure 7  shows
an overlay of both the face > place map and the face attractiveness map,
demonstrating that the face > place peak response is located on the posterior
orbital gyrus, whereas peak activity for face attractiveness is more medially located
within the sulcus. 
 
 
 
 Discussion 
 Attractive faces and attractive places promise very different rewards to a person,
and comparisons are not often made between these rewards. Despite this, our results
demonstrate that the vmPFC exhibits both category-general and category-specific responses to
attractiveness. Clusters sensitive to face attractiveness in vmPFC were also sensitive to
place attractiveness; however, a multivertex pattern analysis found that place and face
attractiveness were distinguishable in one of these clusters, which was located in the
posterior and ventral portion in the right hemisphere. These results suggest that some parts
of vmPFC might encode category-general reward signals even when the stimuli are not
exchangeable goods, while other parts might retain information about category-specific
rewards. In right lateral orbitofrontal cortex (latOFC) we observed two distinct
face-specific regions: one sensitive to the categorical difference between faces and places
but insensitive to face attractiveness, and one sensitive to face (but not place)
attractiveness but insensitive to categorical differences. As we found only face
attractiveness and not place attractiveness signals in latOFC, this region may be more
involved in basic reward processing that is specific to some but not all stimulus
categories. 
 
 Common response to face and place attractiveness in vmPFC 
 In vmPFC, we identified clusters that were sensitive to face attractiveness and
clusters that were sensitive to place attractiveness, and these face and place clusters
were highly overlapping. Further analysis revealed a common response to face and place
attractiveness: clusters in vmPFC identified based on their response to face
attractiveness responded equally strongly to place attractiveness, while clusters
identified based on their response to place attractiveness responded equally strongly to
face attractiveness. 
 These findings are consistent with a recent meta-analysis that demonstrated a
region of vmPFC that encodes a common evaluative signal in studies where two or more
categories were directly compared ( Levy and Glimcher
2012 ). Although most of the studies in the meta-analysis involved economic and
consumer goods, a few compared various social rewards to monetary rewards. Smith et al.
(2010) showed overlapping activity in vmPFC for face attractiveness and monetary value
when subjects passively viewed intermixed images of faces and money.  Lin et al. (2012)  showed overlapping activity in vmPFC between monetary
value and another type of social reward, pictures of smiling or angry people (paired with
audio of emotionally matched words). Our results extend these findings by showing that
even in the case where both judgments are entirely outside the economic domain, in the
realm of aesthetics, an overlapping evaluative signal exists in vmPFC. 
 Indeed, previous findings in the neuroaesthetics literature have suggested that
vmPFC is generally involved in aesthetic evaluations ( Ishizu and Zeki 2013 ;  Brown et al. 2011 ).
For example,  Ishizu and Zeki (2011)  found
overlapping response in vmPFC for beautiful paintings and music, demonstrating that a
common evaluative mechanism in vmPFC is recruited by stimuli of different modalities
(visual, auditory). However, it is possible that their subjects evaluated all of the items
within the same conceptual/reward framework of “artwork” because the items
were presented as such. Our current results demonstrate an important extension to the
results of Ishizu and Zeki, therefore, because faces and places in our study were not
described as artwork, but rather as distinct natural categories. Furthermore, they did not
explore the possibility of separable distributed responses to visual and auditory artwork,
whereas our pattern analysis revealed distinct face and place attractiveness patterns in
at least one region that showed equal mean response between categories. 
 
 
 Category-specific attractiveness coding in vmPFC 
 Our pattern classification analysis revealed that a subregion in right vmPFC
(RvmPFC-place) contains separable distributed response patterns to face and place
attractiveness, even while showing similar mean response. In contrast, the other three
vmPFC clusters, which also showed significant mean response to both place and face
attractiveness did not display evidence of category-specific encoding, suggesting that
category information in vmPFC may be restricted to a posterior and ventral subregion (see
 Figure 4 ) (though null results in the other
clusters cannot be used to ultimately reject the category-specificity hypothesis in those
clusters). 
 While our classification rates were not especially high, they were significantly
greater than chance. Moreover, our results provide an intriguing parallel with results
from a recent study by  McNamee, Rangel, and
O’Doherty (2013)  who also used pattern classification to demonstrate
category-specific encoding for food and trinket value in ventral vmPFC. They also
demonstrated that dorsal regions of vmPFC showed both mean and distributed response
patterns indicative of category- general  encoding, a result that is
consistent with our observation of overlapping mean activity for face and place
attractiveness in vmPFC clusters which did not exhibit category-specific responses in the
classification analysis. Thus, our results provide independent support for the claim that
vmPFC contains category-specific as well as category-general reward information, and
furthermore, we show that these components exist for non-economic rewards. 
 
 
 Face-specific activity in right latOFC 
 We observed two separate regions in right latOFC that contained face-specific
responses, one that exhibited a categorical preference for faces over places and one whose
response scaled with face but not place attractiveness. 
 The previous literature on face attractiveness has not shown consistent results
in latOFC. Two studies have found activity that positively correlated with face
attractiveness in latOFC (left latOFC:  Winston et. al
2007 ; right latOFC:  Tsukiura & Cabeza
2011 ). In contrast, in a passive viewing task,  Liang, Zebrowitz, & Zhang (2010)  showed activity negatively correlated
with face attractiveness in bilateral latOFC, though this study included disfigured faces,
possibly causing an emotional/saliency signal to override a positive attractiveness
response.  O’Doherty et al. (2003)  reported
activity negatively correlated with attractiveness in right latOFC, but in their study,
subjects were making gender judgments rather than attractiveness judgments. When combined
with these previous results, the current data suggest that positive latOFC activity for
face attractiveness may only arise when subjects are explicitly evaluating face
attractiveness. 
 At least two other studies have reported a similar region of right latOFC that
showed greater activation for faces than places ( Rajimehr,
Young, & Tootell 2009 ; Von Der Heide, Skipper, & Olson 2013).
Interestingly, both groups used methods to reduce noise in this frontal region
(surface-based group registration and a tilted acquisition, respectively). It is worth
nothing that this latOFC region should be distinguished from the commonly observed
face-selective region in the lateral inferior frontal cortex, a more dorsal region that is
involved in social attention (see Nummenmaa and Calder 2008 for a meta-analysis). 
 No human neuroimaging study to our knowledge has shown a disjunction between
regions exhibiting face-specific categorical response and regions exhibiting face-specific
attractiveness response in latOFC. Our finding of this functional dissociation provides an
important link to findings from the macaque, where multiple kinds of face-specific
responses have been observed in orbitofrontal cortex ( O
Scalaidhe et al. 1997 ;  Rolls et al. 2006 ;
 Tsao et al. 2008 ;  Watson & Platt 2012 ). Using fMRI, Tsao et al. showed that, in macaque
OFC, a patch on the orbital surface (lateral orbital sulcus) responded more strongly to
faces with emotional expressions than to neutral faces, whereas a more lateral
face-specific patch (inferior convexity) showed a categorical face response that did not
vary with facial emotions. These anatomical locations are congruent with our own results:
the categorical face patch was located on the posterior/lateral gyrus, and the face
attractiveness patch was found in the lateral orbital sulcus. While these similarities are
suggestive of possible functional homologues, more research is needed to test the
robustness and clarify the roles of these regions in humans, especially since the
emotion-patch in macaques responded to both positive and negative faces, whereas we were
only able to test for linear responses to positive faces. 
 It is notable that we did not observe place-specific activity in latOFC. Places,
unlike faces, may not act as a “basic” reward category in the same way as
faces and food. The calculation of place beauty might instead be highly reliant on a
dynamic process of integrating “component parts,” such as spatial envelope
or contrast/lighting, which may be associated with rewards only over time. Barron et al.
have shown evidence that online construction of novel reward categories happens in vmPFC
and hippocampus (2013). In line with this theory, place attractiveness was found in our
data to correlate with activity in vmPFC and at sub-threshold levels in the hippocampal
region. 
 
 
 Visual region differences 
 Consistent with previous findings ( Chatterjee et
al. 2009 ), we observed activity correlated with face attractiveness across a
large area of visual cortex, including face-responsive (FFA) and object-responsive (LOC)
regions. Importantly, this activity was not simply due to time-on-task, as RTs instead
showed non-linear patterns of response to attractiveness. Chatterjee et al. theorized that
response to face attractiveness in the FFA reflects processing of face beauty per se,
while response in LOC reflects processing of visual aesthetics regardless of the category.
They hypothesized that place beauty might activate place-specific mechanisms in the PPA in
addition to general visual aesthetic mechanisms in LOC. While we did observe activity in
right LOC correlating with place attractiveness, consistent with this prediction, we did
not observe attractiveness-related activity in PPA for places. Rather, we observed an
unexpected response to face attractiveness in this region. 
 Why might there be a weaker signal in visual cortex for place attractiveness? As
discussed above, it may the case that faces signify more immediate/basic rewards, and
attractive faces may therefore recruit visual cortex as a part of an automatic approach
response, whereas places would not. It could also be the case that we saw less activity
for place attractiveness because the places spanned a greater variety of environment types
(e.g. forests, beaches, deserts, fields) than did faces (males, females). For example, a
recent study using a narrower range of place stimuli (indoor built environments) showed
that place beauty was correlated with activity in the middle occipital gyrus, although
there was no correlated activity within the ventral visual cortices ( Vartanian et al. 2013 ). One study has reported greater activity in PPA
for preferred scenes versus non-preferred scenes ( Yue,
Vessel, & Biederman 2007 ), but it is important to note that this study
markedly differs from our own in both task and stimuli, in that subjects were asked to
make ratings based on the content of the scenes, many of which were not places but images
containing highly salient foreground objects, people, and animals. While we did observe
response to place attractiveness in the parahippocampal/hippocampal region anterior to the
PPA, this did not survive the stringent threshold for significance in the whole-brain
analysis. Taken as a whole with these previous findings, our data suggest that there are
regions in visual cortex that respond reliably to face attractiveness, but response to
place attractiveness may depend on the nuances of the judgment task or the stimulus
set. 
 
 
 Conclusions 
 Our data demonstrate a bridge between aesthetic and economic neural signals, in
that a functionally similar evaluative mechanism in vmPFC is recruited for these disparate
types of judgments. We expect that further research will continue to illuminate our
understanding of this mechanism as well as the unique neural representations underlying
specific reward categories.

 Figure 1 
 
 Places and faces were presented to subjects in blocks of 12 images. Two 36s
fixation blocks were also included in each scan run. Each face appeared for 1 second with
a 2 second ISI. Subjects made coarse attractiveness ratings for each image in the scanner
(“low”, “medium”, “high” attractiveness),
and then rated the images again outside of the scanner using a Likert scale, 1–8.
The post-rated images were presented to subjects in one randomized block of faces and one
randomized block of places (order counterbalanced across subjects). 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 2 
 
 Diagram illustrating the steps by which univariate and multivariate analyses
were conducted. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 3 
 
 (A) Average of subject-specific histograms of post-scan attractiveness ratings.
Error bars measure the standard error across subjects. (B) Response time plotted as a
function of average attractiveness. Both face and place attractiveness exhibit an
inverted-U shaped function, with the longest response times for mid-range images. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 4 
 
 Cross-subject validation results for univariate cluster-corrected group
analysis. Clusters responding to face attractiveness (blue) and place attractiveness
(green) are shown on the cortical surface. Bar graphs show mean parameter estimates for
face and place attractiveness within these clusters. These parameter values were extracted
using a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation procedure so that data used to define the
clusters were independent of data used to estimate the size of the effects and response
patterns. The black outlines on the medial surface indicate boundaries of vmPFC while
black outlines on the orbital (i.e. ventral) surface indicate boundaries of latOFC. All
vmPFC clusters show significant response to both face and place attractiveness. The face
attractiveness cluster in right latOFC only responds to face attractiveness. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 5 
 
 Multivertex pattern analysis of responses to face and place attractiveness in
vmPFC. Bar graphs show classification accuracy when comparing response patterns across
independent halves of the data. Accuracy (orange bars) was determined by comparing pattern
similarity for attractiveness within a category to pattern similarity for attractiveness
across categories. The breakdown by category (face-face vs. face-place and place-place vs.
face-place) is also shown (blue and green bars). Only one cluster (RvmPFC-place) shows
greater classification accuracy for same vs. different attractiveness categories, though
RvmPFC-face also shows a trend towards significance. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 6 
 
 Wholebrain maps for face (blue) and place (green) attractiveness displayed at
p<. 0005, uncorrected. The FFA is outlined in light blue, and the PPA is outlined
in light green. Note that at this more liberal threshold, vmPFC and ventral striatal
activity is visible for place attractiveness, though these regions did not survive
volumetric wholebrain corrections. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 7 
 
 Relationship between face category effect and face attractiveness effect in PFC.
The face > place effect (dark blue) was thresholded at t>4.0, whereas the
face attractiveness effect (light blue) was thresholded at t>2.0. Both contrasts
were binarized, and the overlapping activity is displayed in pale blue. Peak response for
the categorical effect is located lateral to peak response for face attractiveness in
right OFC (circled). 
 
 
 
 
 Table 1 
 
 Summary table of significant clusters of response for face or place
attractiveness within the vmPFC and latOFC regions of interest (contrast shown in
italics). Coordinates and vertex indices for peak values within the clusters are reported
in fsaverage space (rather than our group-averaged space) for interpretability across
studies. Cluster-wise p-values are permutation corrected for multiple comparisons within
the vmPFC or latOFC and additionally Bonferonni corrected to account for observations
across 2 hemispheres.
