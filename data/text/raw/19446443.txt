 In order to test the hypotheses that pretreatment metabolic activity in
the midbrain and the rostral anterior cingulate may predict remission in
response to medications enhancing monoaminergic transmission, we compared
relative regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rCMRglu) using positron
emission tomography (PET) in medication-free patients with major depression who
remitted after 3 months of monoaminergic medication, with non-remitters on the
same treatment. [ 18 F]-FDG PET was conducted in a group of 33
drug-free DSM-IV major depression subjects prior to antidepressant treatment.
Patients were prescribed paroxetine initially (61%) unless they had failed
paroxetine previously. Treatment was then managed by the subjects’ own
physician with 91% receiving a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and 78%
another non-selective monoamine reuptake inhibitor during the 3 months of
treatment. Voxel-based parametric brain maps of remitters were compared with
maps of non-remitters using SPM2. Remission was defined as a N50% decrease in
and a final score of ≤10 on the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.
We found that treatment remitters have lower activity in a single contiguous
brain region (with global maxima in the midbrain, cluster level
 P =0.013, corrected for multiple comparison (CMC)), prior to
treatment, compared with non-remitters to 3 months of community-based
monoaminergic antidepressant treatment. Degree of improvement correlated with
pretreatment midbrain activity. Pretreatment clinical picture and intensity of
treatment did not distinguish remitters. No other area of the brain showed a
significant difference between remitters and non-remitters even with CMC
completely disabled. Lower relative regional brain activity in the region of
monoaminergic nuclei prior to treatment predicts remission in response to 3
months of antidepressant treatment, despite no clinical differences at baseline
and no difference in treatment intensity. Brain imaging is a potential objective
laboratory technique that may guide treatment selection where clinical methods
have not shown promise. Prospective studies are needed to replicate these
findings and determine whether outcome prediction is limited to a specific class
of antidepressants.

 1. Introduction 
 Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the leading causes of disability
and burden of illness worldwide ( Evans and Charney,
2003 ) and estimated to be second only to cardiovascular disease by 2020
( Michaud et al., 2001 ). Despite this, the
majority of patients with MDD are inadequately treated ( Oquendo et al., 1999 ;  Kessler
et al., 2003 ). Even with adequate treatment, response to treatment,
defined as a 50% improvement in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score,
usually occurs in only 50–60% of individuals ( Panel, 1999 ). Rates of remission after antidepressant treatment, defined
as both a 50% decline in HDRS and a final 17-item score of <7 or <10
for the 24 item HDRS ( Frank et al., 1991 ),
are even lower, only 20%–35% ( Mann,
2005 ). Antidepressants currently in clinical use (selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective norepinephrine reuptake
inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants) primarily target monoaminergic
transmission and much evidence has accumulated demonstrating abnormalities of the
monoaminergic systems in mood disorders. It is unclear why some patients respond
well and others respond poorly to antidepressant treatments that target the
monoaminergic system. Nevertheless, prediction of remission in response to
monoaminergic antidepressants requires an understanding of the biologic
heterogeneity of the etiology and pathophysiology of major depression. 
 Ten studies, conducted after 1989, utilized F 18 -fluorodeoxyglucose
positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) to map brain regions that predict
antidepressant treatment response in MDD ( Wu et al.,
1992 ;  Little et al., 1996 ;  Buchsbaum et al., 1997 ;  Mayberg, 1997 ;  Brody et al.,
1999 ;  Ketter et al., 1999 ;  Kimbrell et al., 1999 ;  Wu et al., 1999 ;  Brannan et al.,
2000 ;  Brody et al., 2001 ;  Kennedy et al., 2001 ;  Saxena et al., 2003 ;  Little et
al., 2005 ); these are summarized in  Table
1 . The rCMRglu in various parts of the temporal lobe region predicted
treatment response in 40% of studies ( Little et al.,
1996 ;  Wu et al., 1999 ;  Saxena et al., 2003 ;  Little et al., 2005 ), various parts of the anterior cingulate
in 60% of the studies ( Mayberg 1997 ;  Brody et al., 1999 ;  Wu et al., 1999 ;  Brannan et al.,
2000 ;  Kennedy et al., 2001 ;  Little et al., 2005 ); various parts of the
prefrontal cortex (PFC) in 70% of studies ( Little et
al., 1996 ;  Buchsbaum et al., 1997 ;
 Wu et al., 1999 ;  Brody et al., 2001 ;  Kennedy et
al., 2001 ;  Saxena et al., 2003 ;
 Little et al., 2005 ). Note however, that
in  Table 1  the studies we found in the
literature do not agree on the exact location (Brodmann area), direction or
laterality of the metabolic change predicting response or non-response to treatment.
There is no ready explanation for these disagreements, but we speculate that some of
these differences may be explained in part by imaging methods and heterogeneity of
relatively small patient samples. In addition, all of these studies investigated
response to treatment and not remission. Remission is a valuable clinical endpoint
because it indicates that treatment has been fully effective; therefore we sought to
determine the brain regions associated with remission. 
 Brain regions that may predict clinical response may be hypothesized based on
the monoamine deficiency hypotheses of depression that posit diminished brain
monoaminergic function ( Achor, 1959 ;  Kur’Ianova, 1959 ;  Stein, 1961 ;  Koutsky et al.,
1962 ;  Bunney and Davis, 1965 ;
 Coppen, 1967 ;  Feer, 1967 ;  Schildkraut,
1967 ;  Coppen, 1969 ;  van Praag et al., 1969 ). We hypothesize that
monoamine reuptake inhibitors are more likely to be therapeutic in cases of
depression where monoaminergic deficiency is part of the abnormality contributing to
the development of the depressive symptoms. If monoaminergic deficiency leads to
abnormal glucose uptake, than FDG-PET may predict remission. Another hypothesized
abnormality that may predict remission is hyperactivity in the rostral anterior
cingulate that is reduced by antidepressant treatment regardless of whether drug or
psychotherapy treatment is employed ( Mayberg et al.,
1997 ). 
 We conducted PET-FDG scans on 33 medication-free patients with MDD who were
awaiting treatment for a major depressive episode (MDE), and then re-evaluated them
after 3 months of naturalistic antidepressant treatment. Remission was defined
 a priori  as a 50% decrease in the 24-item HDRS and a final
score of ≤10 ( Frank et al., 1991 ;
 Bschor et al., 2002 ;  Smith et al., 2002 ). Baseline rCMRglu was
mapped and compared between remitters and non-remitters. As is, evident from  Table 1  there are no replicated and validated
regions of interest (ROIs) predicting remission in the literature; therefore, we
chose an unbiased voxel-based approach to analyze the data in addition to an
ROI-based analysis. 
 
 
 2. Methods 
 
 2.1. Subjects 
 Thirty-three patients enrolled in a baseline PET study agreed to be
followed during their community-based treatment and were included in this study.
All patients met DSM-IV criteria for MDD ( American Psychiatric Association. and American Psychiatric Association.
Task Force on DSM-IV, 1994 ) and a current major depressive episode
with a score greater than 16 on the 17-item HDRS ( Hamilton 1960 ). The subjects gave written informed consent
as approved by the Columbia University Medical Center institutional review
board. Demographic data, psychiatric, medical, developmental and family history
were recorded on Columbia University Baseline Demographic/History Form. History,
physical, and laboratory results were assessed for inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Exclusion criteria included other comorbid Axis-I disorders, significant medical
conditions (especially those affecting the brain or serotonergic system, e.g.:
Cushing’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, migraine and temporal lobe
epilepsy), family history of schizophrenia, pregnancy, the use of medication
known to affect serotonin function (list may be provided upon request) or brain
activity within 2 weeks of the scan except benzodiazepines (ativan, but not
within 3 days of the scan) and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) within 3 months
of the scan. Pre-menopausal women were studied within 14 days of the onset of
menses. 
 
 
 2.2. Treatment 
 Prior to PET scan, patients were medication-free for a minimum of 2 weeks
(6 weeks for fluoxetine hydrochloride and 1 month for oral antipsychotic
agents). Eleven (6 of 11 in the remitter (R) and 5 of 22 in the non-remitter
group (NR)) patients were naïve to psychotropic medication. The R and NR
groups did not differ in the class or type of medication taken ( Table 2 ) prior to entering the study or in
the number of days off medications prior to scanning ( F =0.48,
 df =15,  P =0.8;  F =3.46,
 df =1,  P =0.104, respectively). 
 Physicians employed in the General Clinical Research Unit at the New York
State Psychiatric Institute treated and monitored inpatients. The decision to
treat as outpatient or inpatient was determined based on clinical need.
Inpatients were evaluated by their physicians at least three times weekly and
were monitored continuously by clinical ward staff. Outpatients were evaluated
at least once a week by their community-based psychiatrists. After 4 weeks, all
outpatients in active treatment were seen monthly, unless clinical status
indicated differently. 
 All patients were initially treated with paroxetine (61%) except for
those who had failed paroxetine in the past or where the clinician felt the
patient required ECT. For those initially receiving paroxetine, 20 mg was given
daily for 3 weeks and then adjusted over 6 weeks depending on clinical response
or side effects up to 60 mg per day. Additional pharmacotherapy was added as
deemed necessary by the treating psychiatrist.  Table 2  lists the average number of medications used per patient in
each class of medication. Adequacy and intensity of treatment were determined by
a computerized version ( Oquendo et al.,
2003a , b ) of the Antidepressant
Treatment History Form (ATHF) ( Sackeim et al.,
1990 ). A therapeutic dose was defined as a score of 3 or greater on a
scale of 0 to 5 on this instrument, which scores the adequacy of antidepressant
treatment trials for the major pharmacological antidepressant categories and ECT
and has been shown to have good reliability and validity ( Sackeim et al., 1990 ;  Prudic et al., 1996 ). For all categories of antidepressants, the
minimum duration of the treatment with a specific dose is 4 weeks. The minimum
adequate daily dose for the tricyclics is at least 200 mg of imipramine
hydrochloride or its equivalent; for SSRIs, the minimum daily dose is at least
20 mg of fluoxetine or its equivalent; for phenelzine, the minimum is at least
61 mg; for venlafaxine, the minimum is 225 mg; for bupropion, the minimum is 300
mg; and for ECT, the minimum is more than six unilateral or bilateral
treatments. See the work of  Sackeim et al.
(1990)  for further details. One of the subjects within the remitter
group did not have sufficient data to determine intensity of treatment. 
 
 
 2.3. Baseline evaluation and treatment response, remission assessment 
 Prior to initiating treatment, the severity of disease was measured
using the 24-item HDRS and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) ( Beck and Beamesderfer, 1974 ) within 24 h of
the baseline PET scan and again at 3-months follow-up. The change in rating
scales was calculated by subtracting post-treatment scores from pretreatment
scores. One baseline and two 3-months BDI scores were not available for
analysis. Remission was defined as both a 50% decline in 24-item HDRS and a
final score of ≤10 at the 3-month assessment ( Frank et al., 1991 ;  Bschor
et al., 2002 ;  Smith et al.,
2002 ). All ratings were done by clinicians without knowledge of the
medication and not involved in the treatment of the patients. 
 
 
 2.4. Image acquisition and analysis 
 Acquisitions of PET and MRI images were preformed as previously
described ( Mann et al., 1996a , b ). Five mCi of  18 F-FDG were
administered and subjects looked at a cross-hair in a quiet room for the first
15 min of the uptake phase. Head movement was restricted in the scanner with an
individually molded thermoplastic head holder. Image analysis was performed
using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM2; Institute of Neurology,
University College of London, London, England) implemented in Matlab 6.5 (The
Mathworks Inc, Natick, Mass) ( Friston,
1994 ;  Friston et al., 1995 ),
with spatial normalization and adjusting for multiple comparisons ( Wright et al., 1995 ). The effects of global
metabolism were controlled by normalizing individual voxel counts to total gray
matter counts (global normalization and proportional scaling in SPM2). Smoothing
was done with an 8 mm Gaussian Kernel. A  t -test on a
voxel-by-voxel basis was used to identify clusters where remitters had
significantly higher or lower rates of mean rCMRglu than non-remitters, while
controlling for age and sex. Thresholds were set  a priori  to
 P =0.01 and to  P ≤0.05 for height and
extent thresholds respectively after correction for multiple comparisons by
SPM2. 
 We have previously published the neuroanatomic correlates of the
objective psychopathologic components of MDD in the same cohort using the
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( Milak et al.,
2005 ). Subgroups of this study population were the subject of other
papers including: a subgroup who had a history of a suicide attempt were the
subject of an earlier paper on regional brain correlates of suicidal behavior in
major depression ( Oquendo et al.,
2003a , b ); a subgroup with
borderline personality disorder ( Oquendo et al.,
2005 ); regional brain responses to serotonin in MDD ( Anderson et al., 2004 ); patients with
history of familial mood disorder ( Kegeles et
al., 2003 ); and a subgroup that received ECT therapy ( Nobler et al., 2001 ). Although this cohort
has been studied before, the current article presents new data obtained by
completing follow-up and has never been published before. 
 
 
 
 3. Results 
 
 3.1. Demographic and clinical characteristics 
 Eleven (33%) subjects met remission criteria at 3-month follow-up.
Clinical and demographic data are summarized in  Table 2 . The remitters and non-remitters did not differ on
demographic characteristics. There was a trend for more females in the
non-remitters, and therefore sex was included in the final model as a nuisance
variable. At baseline assessment, there was no difference in the pretreatment
severity of MDD between groups on the HDRS ( P =0.983) and BDI
( P =0.113). There was no group difference in duration of
current MDE ( U =68.5;  z =−1.5;
 P =0.122). As expected at 3 months, remitters had lower
scores on the HDRS (6.2+2.8) and BDI (4.5+3.7) compared with non-remitters
(HDRS=25.4+7.7, BDI=28.1+10.8,  t =−10.4, −9.0;
 df =29.3, 27.3;  P <0.001,
respectively), and showed greater improvement on both HDRS and BDI scores ( Table 2 ). 
 
 
 3.2. Treatment intensity 
 The adequacy and intensity of treatment as assessed by the ATHF score
( Sackeim et al., 1990 ), and the
average number of pharmacologic agents used per subject by medication class,
 did not differ  between remitters and non-remitters during
the treatment phase ( Table 2 ). 
 
 
 3.3. Statistical Parametric Mapping analyses 
 
 3.3.1. Comparing responders vs. non-responders 
 The voxel-based analysis (see  Figs.
1  and  2 ) reveals a single
contiguous brain region where remitters have lower mean rCMRglu compared
with non-remitters (2498 voxels, cluster level  P =0.013
corrected for multiple comparisons, global maximum at Talairach
( xyz ) coordinates of 2, −24, −20,
midbrain). This area encompasses parts of the midbrain, right
parahippocampal gyrus, right putamen, right lateral globus pallidus and
right thalamus (including the ventral lateral and ventral anterior nuclei).
Based on this sample we determined whether higher midbrain metabolic
activity may predict non-remission in MDE, finding specificity=0.64;
sensitivity=0.82; positive predictive value (PPV)=0.82; negative predictive
value (NPV)=0.64 (with sex and midbrain metabolic activity in the logistic
regression model). 
 By conducting a correlation analysis on the entire patient sample
restricted to this region of interest described above (SPM2, small search
volume correction, SVC) we found a significant correlation between the
percent decline in HDRS score in response to treatment and rCMRglu prior to
treatment (927 voxels, cluster level  r 2 =0.32;
 P =0.01 corrected for multiple comparisons, global
maximum at Talairach (xyz) coordinates of 0, −24, −24,
midbrain). 
 Brodmann Area 24 relative activity did not differ between groups,
although ventral limbic structures on the right side showed lower activity
in remitters. Note, however, that we did not exactly replicate the study
cited ( Mayberg et al., 1997 ) as they
compared responders and non-responders to healthy volunteers and not to each
other. Moreover, they reported non-overlapping coordinates in and around the
right anterior cingulate (24a/b)  x =1  y =44
 z =10  z -score=+2.10 for responders and
 x =10  y =38  z =12
 z -score=−3.21 non-responders, where responders
were hypermetabolic (24a/b mean rCMLGlc=1270±70) and non-responders
hypometabolic (1134±111) compared to controls (1198±85).
Nevertheless, in an attempt to avoid the possibility of washing out this
finding with excessive correction for multiple comparisons, we repeated the
analysis, turning off correction and restricting the search volume to an
area located in the same part of BA 24a/b on either side individually, then
combined, comparing remitters to non-remitters. Additionally, we surveyed
the entire cingulate as well, then separately the entire brain and no
suprathreshold voxels were found exceeding a  z -score of
1.96 ( Mayberg et al., 1997 ) with
either methods (outside of the area reported above in our current
results). 
 
 
 3.3.2. Comparing remitters vs. non-remitters 
 Due to the preponderant use of responders vs. non-responders
contrast in studies by others, instead of using remitters vs. non-remitters,
we have reanalyzed the data using those definitions. However, we found no
area in the brain where responders significantly differed from
non-responders, when responder status is evaluated at the 3-months follow-up
(with or without correction for multiple comparisons). 
 
 
 
 
 4. Discussion 
 We found a single contiguous region (with a global maximum in the midbrain)
in depression where lower pretreatment relative metabolic activity predicts
remission after 12 weeks of antidepressant treatment. This distinct difference was
observed in the absence of baseline clinical differences and comparable
antidepressant treatment in remitters and non-remitters. This finding, if
replicated, suggests that brain imaging approach can detect differences, not seen
clinically, that forecast clinical outcome and, as such, may be a step towards the
development of an objective predictor of antidepressant treatment remission. Future
studies need to determine whether brain imaging approaches can predict remission to
specific subtypes of antidepressants in order to facilitate selection of the right
antidepressant for the individual patient. Such predictors should shorten time to
treatment response and remission from initial diagnosis by avoiding the current
trial and error approach in antidepressant selection. This approach may reduce
disease burden due to depression. 
 To date there is no biological marker in routine clinical use to predict
treatment response or remission. This study shows that, despite the absence of
pretreatment clinical differences, this PET scan can detect differences in regional
metabolic brain activity that predict remission. 
 Our findings are consistent with a previous study ( Wu et al., 1999 ) that found lower rCMRglu in responders in the
right mesiotemporal cortex, parts of the basal ganglia and midbrain in responders
(see  Table 1 ). They also find differences
between responders and non-responders in other brain regions, perhaps because they
use sleep deprivation as the treatment. 
 Our study design and outcome measure of remission differ from the studies
summarized in  Table 1  only in part, because
most studies examined degree of clinical improvement. We found that lower rCMRglu in
midbrain and nearby regions predict remission, as well as degree of clinical
improvement. Other studies identified regions such as prefrontal cortex, anterior
cingulate and temporal lobe as related to clinical improvement. Differences in
treatment modalities, patient population and scanning methodology may have
contributed to differences in identified brain regions. Four studies ( Little et al., 1996 ,  2005 ;  Mayberg et al.,
1997 ;  Wu et al., 1999 ) compared
rCMRglu in non-responders versus healthy controls. Some studies enrolled only
outpatients ( Little et al., 1996 ,  2005 ;  Brody et
al., 1999 ,  2001 ;  Kennedy et al., 2001 ;  Saxena et al., 2003 ) whereas others used inpatients exclusively
( Mayberg et al., 1997 ;  Wu et al., 1999 ), and the majority of the
studies followed patients for only 6–8 weeks ( Little et al., 1996 ,  2005 ;  Mayberg et al., 1997 ;  Brody et al., 1999 ;  Kennedy et
al., 2001 ;  Saxena et al., 2003 ).
Treatments for which response was assessed also varied amongst studies (see  Table 1 ). Two studies enrolled subjects with
comorbid Axis-I disorders ( Saxena et al.,
2003 ;  Little et al., 2005 ). One
included only male subjects ( Kennedy et al.,
2001 ). 
 Imaging methods varied with patients scanned at rest ( Mayberg et al., 1997 ;  Brody et
al., 1999 ,  2001 ;  Kennedy et al., 2001 ;  Saxena et al., 2003 ) or performing variations of a continuous
performance task during FDG uptake ( Little et al.,
1996 ,  2005 ;  Buchsbaum et al., 1997 ;  Wu et
al., 1999 ). Studies also varied in method of image analysis, employing
either a region of interest ( Brody et al.,
1999 ;  Wu et al., 1999 ),
Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) ( Little et al.,
1996 ,  2005 ;  Kennedy et al., 2001 ) or both ( Mayberg et al., 1997 ;  Brody et al.,
2001 ;  Saxena et al., 2003 ). Three
studies used correlation analysis to find regions that were associated with
treatment response, correlating baseline rCMRglu and change in HDRS ( Buchsbaum et al., 1997 ;  Brody et al., 1999 ;  Saxena et
al., 2003 ), and Global Assessment Scale (GAS) ( Saxena et al., 2003 ). There are also differences in the methods
used to assess treatment response. Studies defined response based on changes in the
HDRS ( Buchsbaum et al., 1997 ;  Mayberg et al., 1997 ;  Wu et al., 1999 ;  Brody et al.,
2001 ;  Kennedy et al., 2001 ),
Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) ( Little et
al., 1996 ,  2005 ), or a combination
of HDRS with other measures of depression severity, i.e. CGI ( Brody et al., 1999 ) and GAS ( Saxena et al., 2003 ) and set their criteria for response between 40 and
50% decrease in HDRS ( Buchsbaum et al., 1997 ;
 Mayberg et al., 1997 ;  Brody et al., 1999 ;  Wu et al., 1999 ;  Kennedy et
al., 2001 ), and/or a CGI of moderate to marked response ( Little et al., 1996 ,  2005 ;  Brody et al.,
1999 ). One study ( Brannan et al., 2000 )
defined response as a score of ≤2 on the Lickert scale. Another study
included subjects with decreases in the 17-item HDRS; but they were not separated
into responders and non-responders ( Brody et al.,
2001 ). None of these methodological differences offer a direct
explanation of the lack of reproducibility amongst the studies reviewed. An
important problem in imaging studies is correction for multiple comparisons; note
that most of these studies did not report whether such correction was used and/or
how many other contrasts were tested. As mentioned in the Results section, we were
not able to reproduce any of the findings listed in  Table 1  (with one exception noted above), despite using a variety of
different approaches, including one-tailed statistical contrasts without correction
for multiple comparisons and/or restricting the search volume to specific regions of
interest reported to be significant by studies in  Table 1 , which suggests that more standardized approaches and larger
sample sizes are needed in order to avoid type-one error and sampling bias. 
 Several SPECT and PET scans using receptor-specific radioligands have found
abnormal binding in the brainstem of depressed patients ( Drevets et al., 1999 ,  2007 ;  Morris et al., 1999 ;  Dahlstrom et al., 2000 ;  Willeit et al., 2000 ;  Bhagwagar
et al., 2004 ;  Laasonen-Balk et al.
2004 ;  Uusitalo et al., 2004 ;  Newberg et al., 2005 ;  Lehto et al., 2006 ,  2008 ;  Meyer et al., 2006 ;  Joensuu et al., 2007 ;  Walter et al., 2007 ;  Miller et
al., 2008 ;  Reimold et al., 2008 ).
More recently, we and others have begun to scan indices of specific neurotransmitter
systems, as predictors of antidepressant response. It has been reported that MDD
patients with serotonin transporter (5-HTT) promoter region insertion were more
responsive to placebo, as well as more responsive to SSRI than was the short allele
group ( Rausch et al., 2002 ). We found that
lower serotonin transporter binding predicts poorer antidepressant response ( Miller et al., 2006 ). Innis and colleagues
found that higher pretreatment diencephalic 5-HTT availability significantly
predicted better treatment response 4 weeks later ( Kugaya et al., 2004 ). Linking these neurotransmitter-specific scan
findings to more than just SSRI responses is an important future area of research.
We also report elsewhere ( Parsey et al.,
2006a , b ) that non-remission of
major depression is associated with higher pretreatment brainstem 5-HT 1A 
binding (midbrain autoreceptors) and relate that to the higher autoreceptor
expressing GG genotype. Based on this  imaging  finding the following
model was proposed: the GG polymorphism is associated with greater 5-HT 1A 
gene expression in the midbrain raphe nuclei and hence the higher 5-HT 1A 
binding. As the 5-HT 1A  receptors are presynaptic auto-inhibitory, more
5-HT 1A  raphe autoreceptors would result in less serotonin neuron
firing and decreased terminal field 5-HT release. This may be followed by a
homeostatic upregulation of post-synaptic terminal field 5-HT 1A 
receptors. The GG genotype by itself is also associated with resistance to a variety
of antidepressant treatments ( Albert 2004 ;
 Lemonde et al., 2004 ). 
 An important question is, how lower midbrain metabolic activity in
remitters, in the present study, may be reconciled with fewer 5-HT 1A 
autoreceptors in the midbrain as predictors of better treatment outcome or,
specifically, of remission? Since activating the 5-HT 1A  receptors causes
the opening of the potassium (K + ) channels, fewer available
5-HT 1A  receptors are associated with the closing of the K + 
channels in the raphe serotonergic cell bodies. This in turn decreases the workload
of the ATP-dependent K +  pump, leading to lower metabolic activity in
midbrain of the remitters. A major fraction of cerebral energy production is
required for the extrusion of intracellular Na+ that enters during excitation and
depolarization of neurons in other parts of the brain, suggesting higher firing
leading to higher metabolic rates. However, in the raphe under wakeful rest and
uneventful waking activity, serotonergic neurons display slow, clock-like activity
of about 1 to 5 spikes/s ( Jacobs and Fornal
1993 ;  Frazer and Hensler, 1999 ).
This slow firing barely changes (~1 to 1.25×) the resting workload of
the Na/K-ATPase activity ( Albers and Siegel,
1999 ). Therefore remitters with lower somato-dentritic 5-HT 1A 
receptor expression, and consequently closed K +  channels, will have lower
midbrain metabolic activity (despite slightly higher firing rates) than
non-remitters. 
 Our results show that some subcortical ventral monoaminergic projection
areas such as right parahippocampal gyrus, right putamen, right lateral globus
pallidus and right thalamus, also have lower metabolic rates before treatment in
remitters. We know from earlier studies that MDD subjects have higher rCMRglu in
these regions prior to treatment ( Milak et al.,
2005 ), suggesting that those who later turn out to be remitters have less
elevation in activity in these regions, prior to treatment, compared with patients
who do not remit. In other words, less abnormality in those regions predicts better
response. These findings are consistent with transmitter imaging studies of the
5-HT 1A  and serotonin transporter binding sites where less abnormality
predicts better treatment response ( Parsey et al.,
2006a , b ). 
 It was first reported by  Mayberg et al.
(1997)  that rCMRglu in the anterior cingulate may also be a predictor of
favorable treatment response (not remission) by 60% of the studies. Note however,
that there is disagreement between these studies in the location and direction of
change in rCMRglu that discriminated responders from non-responders (see  Table 1 ), moreover this metabolic abnormality
was interpreted as an adaptive or compensatory response (not considered to be
causally related) to depression and it was suggested that failure of this
compensatory response may underlie poor outcome ( Mayberg et al., 1997 ). We did not detect a relationship of remission or
response with the subgenual anterior cingulate, perhaps in part because our study
was designed for a different endpoint to improvement, but clearly this difference
needs further research. 
 
 Limitations 
 This study involved a naturalistic community-based treatment, making the
results more relevant to clinical practice, but as a consequence patients
received a variety of treatments. Nevertheless 97% of the patients received
antidepressant medications that increase monoaminergic transmission. Future
controlled double blind cross-over studies are needed to determine whether brain
imaging before treatment can predict improvement regardless of the mechanism by
which the treatment enhances monoaminergic transmission, — or the
findings described here are specific effects of a particular class of
antidepressants.

 A human brain map in major depression depicting the region where antidepressant
remitters demonstrate lower regional rates of cerebral glucose metabolism in
comparison to the non-remitters. The color scale in the figure indicates the
strength ( t -score) of the correlation ( t -score
maps are overlaid on a series of transaxial slices (2 mm apart) of a
coregistered MRI scan from 42 mm below to a 26 mm above a line connecting the
anterior and posterior commissure).
