 Depression remains a great societal burden and a major treatment challenge. Most
antidepressant medications target serotonergic raphé nuclei. Acute tryptophan
depletion (ATD) modulates serotonin function. To better understand the
raphé's role in mood networks, we studied raphé functional
connectivity in depression. Fifteen depressed patients were treated with sertraline for 12
weeks and scanned during ATD and sham conditions. Based on our previous findings in a
separate cohort, resting state MRI functional connectivity between raphé and other
depression-related regions (ROIs) was analyzed in narrow frequency bands. ATD decreased
raphé functional connectivity with the bilateral thalamus within
0.025–0.05 Hz, and also decreased raphé functional connectivity with the
right pregenual anterior cingulate cortex within 0.05–0.1 Hz. Using the control
broadband filtlter 0.01–0.1 Hz, no significant differences in raphé-ROI
functional connectivity were observed. Post-hoc analysis by remission status suggested
increased raphé functional connectivity with left pregenual anterior cingulate
cortex in remitters ( n  = 10) and decreased raphé functional
connectivity with left thalamus in non-remitters ( n  = 5), both within
0.025–0.05 Hz. Reducing serotonin function appears to alter coordination of these
mood-related networks in specific, low frequency ranges. For examination of effects of
reduced serotonin function on mood-related networks, specific low frequency BOLD fMRI
signals can identify regions implicated in neural circuitry and may enable
clinically-relevant interpretation of functional connectivity measures. The biological
significance of these low frequency signals detected in the raphé merits further
study.

 1. Introduction 
 Depression remains a great societal burden and a major treatment challenge.
Depression and suicide are associated with altered serotonin function ( Maes et al., 1995 ;  Delgado et al.,
1999 ;  Engstrom et al., 1999 ;  Caspi et al., 2003 ;  Bach-Mizrachi et al., 2006 ,  2008 ;  Meyer, 2007 ). Altered serotonergic markers in depression
and suicide have been identified specifically in the raphé nuclei ( Bach-Mizrachi et al., 2006 ,  2008 ). Serotonin and the raphé are targets of most antidepressant
medications ( Scuvee-Moreau and Dresse, 1979 ;  Blier and El Mansari, 2013 ). 
 Depression and its treatments are also associated with altered functional
connectivity across multiple neural networks ( Greicius et
al., 2007 ;  Fales et al., 2009 ;  Sheline et al., 2010 ;  Wang et al., 2012 ;  Zhu et al., 2012 ;  Li et al., 2013 ;  Posner
et al., 2013 ), but have not been linked to regions associated with specific
neurotransmitter function. Changes in functional connectivity of the raphé during
tryptophan depletion were recently reported ( Salomon et al.,
2011 ) and may be a promising biomarker for depression. Further exploration of this
proxy measure of serotonergic activity is needed. 
 Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) connectivity metrics depend on
specific frequencies of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activation and anatomical
projections between the involved regions. While the BOLD fMRI signal does not directly
measure neural behavior, it has been correlated with measures of neural activity at specific
frequencies ( Logothetis and Wandell, 2004 ;  Scholvinck et al., 2010 ;  Magri et al., 2012 ). Frequencies of BOLD activation in the raphé may be
influenced by raphé neuron activity. Spontaneous firing rates of neurons in the
raphé occur within a range of 0.5–2.5 Hz ( Aghajanian et al., 1978 ), which overlaps with frequencies detectable by fMRI.
Raphé stimulation at low (0.5 Hz) frequencies produces an increase in serotonin
release, differing markedly from higher frequency (10 Hz) stimulation which is associated
with decreases in release ( Sheard and Aghajanian,
1968 ). Further, models of depression are associated with changes in raphé
firing rates at low (0.2 Hz) frequencies ( Yavari et al.,
1993 ). Low (0.3 Hz) frequency activity in the raphé also appears to be
related to antidepressant effects ( Sheard et al.,
1972 ). Local firing rate adjustments during serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SRI)
treatments, such as sertraline, coincide with mood response ( Blier et al., 1987 ;  de Montigny et al.,
1990 ;  Chaput et al., 1991 ;  Blier and de Montigny, 1994 ;  Owens, 1996 ;  Evans et al., 2008 ).
Together this evidence indicates that patterns of neuronal activity within the raphé
relates significantly to depressive symptomatology and response to treatment. 
 Differential functional coupling of the raphé with extra-raphé
regions likely relies on neuronal projections of the serotonin network, since the other
neurons in the raphé are local interneurons. Serotonergic neurons from the brainstem
pontomesencephalic raphé (which we will refer to here as dorsal raphé)
project broadly to limbic cortical and other regions, including the thalamus ( Baker et al., 1990 ,  1991a ;  Jacobs and Azmitia, 1992 ).
Reciprocally, feedback from cortical regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex and
subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, provides rapid and reversible effects on serotonergic
neuronal function in the raphé ( Amat et al.,
2005 ;  Gabbott et al., 2005 ;  Warden et al., 2012 ). These anatomical and functional
relationships with the raphé predict a role for raphé connectivity using
fMRI connectivity approaches. 
 To test for changes in raphé functional connectivity with mood-related
regions, a challenge paradigm is useful. Modulation of serotonin precursor availability by
acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) decreases serotonin synthesis in the raphé and has
been associated with worsening mood ( Delgado et al.,
1990 ). ATD alters intra-raphé activation frequencies and
raphé-to-other-region functional connectivity ( Salomon et al., 2011 ). 
 In the present study, MRI functional connectivity was analyzed in narrow frequency
ranges comparable to those used in the prior study, but using a new, prospectively
sertraline-treated, depressed cohort. Based on findings from the prior study, we
hypothesized that raphé-to-ROI functional connectivity would decrease with reduced
serotonin availability during ATD. As in the prior study of connectivity with the dorsal
raphé, we selected brain regions (ROIs) implicated in the pathophysiology of
depression or known to be rich in serotonergic innervation. 
 
 
 2. Methods 
 This study of ATD effects on raphé activation was designed with
considerable caution regarding the reliability of changes in fMRI signal in a region
putatively identified as anatomically consistent with dorsal raphé, with full
awareness and many precautions to limit the risk that nearby tissues might be involved. 
 
 2.1. Design and sample 
 An institution-wide email solicited depressed adults, age 18–50, who were
medication-free for at least 4 weeks. A current DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of major depressive
disorder was determined by clinical interview and confirmed with a structured diagnostic
interview using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, MINI ( Sheehan et al., 1998 ). Included participants also
scored 18 or higher on the 17-item Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAM-D) ( Hamilton, 1960 ) and remission was defined as
post-sertraline treatment HAM-D score less than eight. 
 Participants were excluded for other current primary psychiatric diagnosis,
current or prior need for inpatient management, sertraline failure or documented
treatment-resistance, substance use within 1 month, daily nicotine use, pregnancy or
lactation, oral contraceptive use, migraine, hepatitis, endocrinopathy, or metal implants.
All participants provided signed informed consent before beginning study procedure. The
Vanderbilt Institutional Review Board approved this study. 
 All participants were treated with sertraline 50 mg daily for 1 week, then 100
mg for 11 weeks. Participants were allowed 0.5 mg lorazepam for 3 doses in the first week
of sertraline. Beyond the first week, all participants were restricted to sertraline
monotherapy. Clinical visits occurred every 1–2 weeks during the treatment period.
HAM-D assessments were completed at baseline and at each follow-up visit. After 12 weeks
of treatment, each subject participated in two random-sequence, double-blind test days
that were one week apart. Each test day morning consisted of General Clinical Research
Center admission, HAM-D mood rating, blood draw for plasma tryptophan concentration, and
administration of either the sham or ATD diet. Randomization and blinding was performed by
the Vanderbilt Investigational Drug Service, which prepared the amino acid mixtures for
both diets. Active ATD amino acid (100 g, ‘full-strength’) mixtures
contained 15 amino acids in the balance found in human milk, but without tryptophan, as
detailed previously ( Delgado et al., 1990 ;  Salomon et al., 2011 ). Control diets were identical,
but included L-tryptophan. Six hours later (at 3 pm), HAM-D mood rating and blood sampling
were repeated, immediately prior to the 45–60-min MRI scan. Morning and afternoon
mood ratings used all items from the HAM-D, with carry-forward of sleep and appetite items
through the day. The participant was given a normal, tryptophan-rich meal after the
conclusion of the scan, regardless of which diet was received. One week later, the test
day procedure was repeated with the alternate diet ( i.e.  if the
participant had first received the ATD diet, the procedure was repeated with the sham
diet). 
 
 
 2.2. MRI acquisition 
 Imaging data were collected on a 3T Phillips Integra scanner. For each session
the scan sequence included a 3D T1 anatomical (6.5 min, 1 mm 3  isotropic voxel
size) and a 6.7 min resting-state BOLD scan (200 volumes, TR 2000 msec, TE 25 msec, 30
slices, 3.75 × 3.75 mm 2  in-plane resolution, 4.5 mm thick and 0.5 mm
gap). For the resting-state scans, participants were instructed to lie still and close
their eyes but stay awake. 
 
 
 2.3. Data analysis 
 
 2.3.1. Preprocessing 
 Structural and functional imaging data was preprocessed using SPM8 ( Friston et al., 1994 ) toolbox for Matlab (MathWorks,
Inc., Massachusetts, United States). For intra-subject comparability between sessions, a
mean structural image was calculated for each subject across conditions prior to
segmentation. We applied slice-timing and motion correction to each functional session.
The mean functional image was then calculated and used to create a coregistration
transform for each of the sessions' functional data to the mean structural
image. Finally, for each subject, the structural, subject-specific raphé ROI,
and functional volumes were all normalized to ICBM-152 MNI (Montreal Neurologic
Institute) template space to enable inter-subject comparability. 
 
 
 2.3.2. Region of interest selection and identification 
 
 2.3.2.1. Raphé 
 Due to its small anatomical size and nearby nonraphé structures, the
subject-specific dorsal raphé was hand-drawn conservatively on the structural
image, as described previously ( Salomon et al.,
2011 ). The pontomesencephalic pontine raphé region (approximating
dorsal portions) was defined on the first transverse slice where both cerebral
peduncles were well-defined immediately superior to the pons, one transverse
anatomical slice (1 mm) superior to the isthmus and immediately anterior to the fourth
ventricle. This slice was parallel and 16–30 mm inferior to the transverse
plane defined by the anterior and posterior commissures. Due to the lack of clear
anatomical boundaries for this region from the surrounding regions, the width of the
dorsal raphé nucleus was defined as one third the total width of the midbrain
at that level and a height of 3 (mm) voxels. The posterior border was defined 2 mm
anterior to the aqueduct ( Baker et al., 1990 ,
 1991a ,  1991b ). We deliberately did not use smoothing of functional data in order to
minimize contamination from nearby tissues. Due to the potential for displacement of
this small region during normalization, we reviewed the raphé ROI's
location on each subject's structural image after normalization and adjusted
its location to ensure that it was still correctly placed on the dorsal raphé
( Fig. 1 ). 
 
 
 2.3.2.2. Target regions 
 The anterior thalamus and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC)
regions replicated those in our prior study using MNI coordinates from WFU Pick Atlas
( Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002 ;  Maldjian et al., 2003 ,  2004 ). Additional exploratory ROIs with rich serotonergic
innervation and known changes in depression included the subgenual anterior cingulate
cortex (sgACC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Further, cognitive
exploratory targets included dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and posterior
cingulate cortex (PCC). The sgACC coordinates were based on  Mayberg et al. (1997) . The remaining three regions used CONN
toolbox standards (see  Table 1 ). 
 
 
 
 2.3.3. Functional connectivity analysis 
 An ROI-to-ROI bivariate correlation analysis was facilitated by CONN
Functional Connectivity toolbox for Matlab, version13o ( Whitfield-Gabrieli and Ford, 2012 ;  Whitfield-Gabrieli and Nieto-Castanon, 2012 ). Regression removed effects of
motion (6 rigid body parameters and their first differences) and 5 principal components
from each of the white matter and cerebrospinal fluid ROIs. 
 Bandpass temporal frequency filtering isolated narrow frequency bands to
closely mimic the prior study, which had used a wavelet procedure that influenced
frequency boundaries, giving non-discrete cut-offs with odd values of
0.25–0.125, 0.125–0.0625, 0.0625–0.03125 Hz, and a residual band
of <0.03125 Hz. In CONN, finite impulse response (FIR) filtering provides
discrete frequency cut-offs so that boundaries could be selected for separate analyses
at 0.01–0.025 Hz, 0.025–0.05 Hz, and 0.05–0.1 Hz. An analysis
using a standard fMRI frequency filtlter of 0.01–0.1 Hz was also conducted for
comparison. 
 In second-level analyses, we computed the difference in functional
connectivity between sham and ATD conditions for each raphé-to-ROI pair. We used
a general linear model with separate categorical predictors for remitters and
non-remitters, where remission was defined as post-sertraline treatment HAM-D score less
than eight. When we contrasted diet conditions across all subjects, predictors for
remitters and non-remitters were combined with weights proportionate to their respective
subgroup size. 
 
 
 
 
 3. Results 
 
 3.1. Demographics 
 Phone screens yielded 37 individuals eligible for interview, of whom 18 entered
and 17 completed the protocol. Data were dropped for non-adherence to the protocol
( n  = 1) and for an inconsistent blind per pharmacy and laboratory
documentation ( n  = 1), giving a final sample of 15. Mean age was 35 years
( SD  = 7, range 25–46). Nine (60%) were male. Mean HAM-D
score before SSRI was 21 and scores did not significantly differ between subsequent
remitters (mean = 20,  SD  = 1.9) and non-remitters (mean = 23,
 SD  = 5.6,  t  = 1.6, 13  df ,
 p  = 0.13). Sertraline 100 mg daily was tolerated in all subjects.
Remission (HAM-D < 8) was achieved in 10 of the 15 subjects (7 males and 3
females). Mean HAM-D scores after treatment ( i.e.  at week-12 clinic
visit) were 3.8 ( SD  = 2.6) in remitters and 15.8 ( SD  =
5.6) in non-remitters ( t  = 5.3, df = 13,  p  = 0.0002).
Participants' morning pre-diet HAM-D scores did not significantly differ between
sham and ATD test days (mean pre-sham = 6.7,  SD  = 4.1, mean pre-ATD =
7.9,  SD  = 5.4,  t  = 1.07,  df  =
14 , p  = 0.305). 
 
 
 3.2. Tryptophan depletion 
 Post-ATD plasma tryptophan levels in all participants dropped below 15
µmol/L (mean = 3.8), compared to a range of 20–136 µmol/L (mean =
56.4) for sham diets (mean difference = 53.4,  t  = 6.63,
 df  = 13,  p  < 0.0001). No individual showed a
mood relapse with ATD (HAM-D score pre-ATD mean = 7.9,  SD  = 5.4, post-ATD
mean = 7.2,  SD  = 4.6,  t  = 1.16,  df  =
14,  p  = 0.265), and mean mood scores did not change significantly
compared to morning baseline ( t  = 0.90,  df  = 14,
 p  = 0.38). There were no serious adverse events and the study protocol
was well-tolerated. 
 
 
 3.3. Functional connectivity analysis 
 Analysis of motion on a per voxel basis revealed that the 95th percentile of
displacement relative to the preceding volume was 0.8 mm or less in all sessions from all
subjects, so none were rejected for excessive movement. 
 Table 2  shows functional connectivity
results for the raphé with the selected ROIs after SSRI treatment. In all cases,
differences in functional connectivity are reported as sham minus ATD conditions. When we
examined all participants' data using the narrow frequency band 0.025–0.05
Hz, we found that ATD significantly altered raphé functional connectivity with
both the right and left thalamus. Within 0.05–0.1 Hz, ATD decreased raphé
functional connectivity with the right pregenual ACC. Using the control broadband filtlter
0.01–0.1 Hz, no significant differences in raphé-ROI functional
connectivity were observed with ATD. 
 In exploratory analyses of functional connectivity considering remitted and
non-remitted subjects separately, raphé functional connectivity changes with ATD
were identified only in the frequency range 0.025–0.05 Hz. In remitters
( n  = 10), ATD  increased  functional connectivity in
this frequency range between the raphé and left pregenual ACC. In the
non-remitters ( n  = 5), ATD  decreased  functional
connectivity between the raphé and left thalamus. Additionally, when stratified by
remission status, HAM-D score in non-remitters significantly correlated with raphé
functional connectivity with the right anterior thalamus in 0.025–0.05 Hz
( r  = −0.96,  p  < 0.01) and left
pregenual ACC in 0.025–0.05 Hz ( r  = 0.89,  p  =
0.04). In remitters, higher HAM-D score trended to correlate with raphé functional
connectivity with the left anterior thalamus in 0.01–0.025 Hz ( r 
= −0.62,  p  < 0.06). 
 
 
 
 4. Discussion 
 This study shows ATD effects in remitted depression on a region consistent with
the pontomesencephalic dorsal raphé using resting-state functional connectivity.
Following the hypothesis that was based on findings from our previous study ( Salomon et al., 2011 ), we again found that ATD effects on
raphé functional connectivity were limited to a narrow low frequency bandwidth.
Again, as in the first study, we did not observe effects of ATD on raphé functional
connectivity in the full bandwidth in all subjects. This is consistent with our previous
findings in SSRI-treated patients following challenges with ATD or sham diets ( Salomon et al., 2011 ). 
 In this new data set, significant decreases in functional connectivity for the
raphé with both the left and right thalamus were again specific to the frequency
range 0.025–0.05 Hz (see note below regarding filtering methods). Additionally,
significant decreases in functional connectivity between raphé and pregenual ACC
were specific to the 0.05–0.1 Hz frequency range. Since these effects were not
detected using the customary frequency range of 0.01–0.1 Hz, narrower frequency
bands appear to be critical for detecting changes in raphé functional connectivity.
Imaging measures of raphé function in depression that specify narrower frequency
ranges may allow a novel probe of serotonergic neuromodulation relevant to depression. 
 To our knowledge, this is the first report of the effects of ATD on raphé
functional connectivity in prospectively-treated depression. The prior study recruited only
remitted patients, whereas the present study cohort was recruited prior to treatment
initiation, allowing a secondary analysis of remitters and non-remitters. While the prior
analysis used custom programming with wavelet filtlters (which have sloped frequency
cut-offs), another advantage of the current study is the demonstration of raphé
functional connectivity changes using more discrete frequency band cut-offs and
widely-accepted image analysis tools (SPM8 and CONN). These tools utilize the functional
connectivity literature-standard frequency filtering methods and also provide MNI-normalized
region selection. When comparing findings from these two studies, it should be noted that
the relative widths of the frequency bands were retained approximately from the previous
study; the only significant difference was the starting point for decimation (or the upper
bound): 0.1 Hz instead of 0.25 Hz, to be more conservative about exclusion of physiologic
noise, in accordance with convention. As a result, the ranges used for the narrower
frequency bandpass filtlters are not exactly identical, but are sufficiently similar to
allow meaningful comparisons. 
 The frequency-specific property of the observed ATD-induced functional
connectivity changes is not unusual. Frequency-specific properties of resting state BOLD
signal have been shown to be spatially distributed and linked to network connectivity, and
examination of BOLD oscillation properties of the default mode network has revealed a
distinct frequency-dependent regional composition across subjects ( Baria et al., 2011 ), but the biological significance of these frequency
ranges is unknown. There are several possible physiologic explanations for the observed
ATD-induced functional connectivity changes. The anterior thalamus is rich in serotonin
receptors and transporter-rich terminals ( Chapin and
Andrade, 2001 ;  Marek et al., 2001 ;  Varnas et al., 2004 ). Raphé serotonin neuron
projections to thalamus are known to modulate thalamocortical activity ( Andersen et al., 1983 ;  McCormick, 1992 ;  Steriade, 1999 ). One
possibility is that the observed functional connectivity relationships represent slow
oscillators and that ATD-induced functional connectivity changes are a proxy for
serotonergic effects on physiologically-important slow oscillations. This variability may be
related to feedback mechanisms within the serotonin system. For example, our findings for
raphé-thalamic functional connectivity at frequencies < 1 Hz is analogous to
the < 1 Hz thalamic oscillations observed during sleep and may inform the
relationship between sleep disturbances and depression ( Buysse et al., 1990 ). 
 It is also possible that diminished serotonergic transmission in depressive states
may impair self-regulation of raphé firing variability. Altered serotonin function
clearly plays a role in depression and its treatment ( Blier
and El Mansari, 2013 ) and a potential role for slow oscillations in serotonin
function has been hypothesized ( Salomon and Cowan,
2013 ). Changes in network activity may be modulated by raphé activity at
low frequency. Such slow fluctuations <1 Hz may be generated by cell metabolic
cycles, or local positive and negative tissue feedback loops ( Hu et al., 2007 ,  2008 ;  Novak et al., 2007 ;  Pigolotti et al., 2007 ;  Tiana et al., 2007 ;
 Novak and Tyson, 2008 ;  Tsai et al., 2008 ). Consistent with this, changes in BOLD signal are
thought to be closely related to functions of local interneurons ( Gsell et al., 2006 ). Locally, serotonin inhibits excitatory interneurons
( Adell et al., 2001 ;  Celada et al., 2001 ;  Martin-Ruiz et al.,
2001 ;  Ciranna, 2006 ;  Grasso et al., 2006 ). ATD may weaken this inhibition, allowing an
increase GABA to further inhibit serotonin release, but this too warrants further study. 
 While there is extensive evidence of serotonergic effects on metabolic activity
(assumed to be driven primarily by neuronal activity) as measured by FDG-PET ( Morris et al., 1999 ) and neuronal oscillations as
measured by EEG and LFP recordings (comprehensively reviewed by  Celada et al., 2013 ), it is also possible that not all changes in
hemodynamics related to ATD are secondary to changes in neuronal activity. Since our fMRI
measures are derived from hemodynamic properties (BOLD) and serotonin can modulate vascular
flow ( Kelley et al., 1988 ), the observed functional
connectivity changes may reflect direct effects of ATD on the vasculature and/or changes in
neurovascular coupling, rather than the inter-regional coordination of underlying neural
activity ( Chugani et al., 1999 ;  Adnot et al., 2013 ;  Hillman,
2014 ). While it is unknown whether ATD could also affect neurovascular coupling,
there is little evidence to support this possibility without it also affecting neuronal
activity or oscillations ( Anderer et al., 2000 ;  Tfelt-Hansen and Koehler, 2011 ). Moreover, since several
this study's ROIs have rich serotonergic innervation and ATD-induced raphé
connectivity changes were only observed with the thalamus and anterior cingulate; it is
unlikely that ATD effects on neurovascular coupling would be regionally-specific among the
projection sites we examined. A conservative interpretation is that our findings indicate
that ATD induced some combination changes in neural signaling, neurometabolic activity, and
neurovascular coupling in specific pairs of regions within specific frequency regions.
Further research is needed to clarify the underlying mechanisms of ATD-induced alterations
in raphé functional coupling. 
 Our exploratory analyses stratified for remission suggest group-specific
differences in the effect of reducing serotonin function on raphé functional
connectivity. In analyses of the entire cohort, we observed a  decrease  in
functional connectivity in 0.05–0.1 Hz frequency range with ATD between the
raphé and the right pgACC. However, analyses of remitters alone showed an
 increase  in functional connectivity at 0.025–0.05 Hz frequency
range between the raphé and the left pgACC. Identification of ATD-induced changes
functional connectivity with the pgACC is consistent with many findings associating the
pgACC with mood changes in depression ( Mayberg et al.,
1997 ;  Price and Drevets, 2010 ). Our
preliminary findings relating raphé-pgACC functional connectivity to remission
status suggest that these oscillators may fluctuate with depression severity or SSRI
treatment response. As such, it is possible that raphé-pgACC connectivity may
represent a biomarker of SSRI-induced remission. However, this exploratory analysis is
limited by the small subgroup sample size. 
 Several limitations of this study must be noted. Power in this study was limited
in more than one aspect. The study had a small sample size, especially for the non-remitted
cohort subgroup analyses, as noted above. Decomposing our signal into narrower frequency
bands also limited our power. This study was designed to test one specific hypothesis
(decreased functional connectivity in thalamus-raphé at a specific frequency) and
despite the small sample size and narrow frequency bands, our results support our
hypothesis. If we correct for the comparison of three frequency bands, some results remain
statistically significant. Raphé connectivity with the left thalamus remains highly
significant (Bonferroni- corrected- p =0.02) while the right
thalamus-raphé loses statistical validity
(Bonferroni-corrected- p =1.5). To examine narrow frequency bands with more
power in future studies, longer scans may be of greater interest. 
 The small size and location of the pontomesencephalic raphé raises concern
for anatomical variation and partial volume effects. To minimize this concern, raphé
ROIs were conservatively hand-drawn, reviewed after normalization and, also, a single
placement was applied to both scans from each subject. However, deviations due to partial
volume effects in the case of less serotonergic pararaphé regions would be expected
to weaken the signal we are detecting, and are unlikely to produce a false-positive result.
Also, if our raphé region selection overlapped with the median raphé, our
finding would remain important. 
 Design limitations are also inherent in the target ROI selection and
identification process. By using an  a priori  hypothesis that focused on a
few specific ROIs, we strengthened the statistical power of our finding and minimized the
risk of false positives from multiple comparisons; but we also sacrificed possible detection
of any other potentially-involved regions that were not examined under our hypothesis. Since
serotonergic neurons project throughout the brain, there could be many additional networks
of relevance to be examined. Additionally, we identified our ROIs structurally based on
established, standard coordinates; subject-specific functionally-identified ROIs may have
enabled individual specificity, but also would have limited generalizability of our
results. 
 Although this study does not examine neural networks directly, it supports past
work demonstrating that ATD is a useful probe for modulating neural networks dependent on
serotonergic innervation ( Kahkonen et al., 2005 ;
 Evers et al., 2006 ;  Merens et al., 2008 ;  Roiser et al., 2009 ;
 Daly et al., 2010 ;  Van der Veen et al., 2010 ;  Booij and Van der Does,
2011 ;  Kunisato et al., 2011 ). This study
also extends this by indirectly demonstrating involvement of pontomesencephalic
raphé. ATD effects on resting state fMRI of raphé functional connectivity
may yield improved techniques for understanding raphé functional changes in
depression. Although the BOLD fMRI signal is not a direct measure of neural activity, this
modality provides a window to examine slow frequency functional characteristics of
raphé regions in humans. The fMRI measure originates from the hemodynamic response,
and not directly from neural activity. When fMRI measurements are taken simultaneous with
neuronal recordings, the fMRI signal does track neural oscillations (often slow
oscillations) ( Logothetis and Wandell, 2004 ;  Magri et al., 2012 ). Our study also shows that
oscillatory activity within the fMRI record relates to serotonergic state. Perhaps this
supports using fMRI as an alternative to understand how oscillatory activity relates to
depression, but the direct relationship between the oscillatory pattern within the fMRI
signal and actual neuronal activity has yet to be established. Elucidating the relationships
among actual neural activity and various measures remains a work in progress. Future
investigations of slow neural oscillations and neurovascular coupling characteristics in
depression may help to explain pathogenesis of depressive symptomatology and its treatment.
Studies of antidepressant effects on BOLD fMRI and functional connectivity are also needed.
Relationships among oscillations in different frequency ranges may have important clinical
implications, such as sleep and depression, or be predictive of treatment response. Future
studies of depression should examine the clinical implications of alterations in and
oscillations of raphé functional connectivity.

 pgACC, sgACC, and anterior thalamus ROIs were conservatively created as 5 mm
radius spheres. As standard in CONN toolbox, dlPFC, vmPFC, and PCC volumes approximated
10 mm radius spheres. For the dorsal raphé, each subject-specific rectangular
volume was hand-drawn as detailed in the text. Raphé sizes ranged from 3 to 10
voxels of 8 mm 3 . 
 
 
 DBS = deep brain stimulation; dlPFC = dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; DMN =
default mode network; PCC = posterior cingulate cortex; pgACC = pregenual anterior
cingulate cortex; ROI = region of interest; sgACC = subgenual anterior cingulate cortex;
SRI = serotonin reuptake inhibitor; vmPFC = ventromedial prefrontal cortex.

 Changes in functional connectivity
(Δ Z ( r )) between sham and ATD
( Z ( r ) sham minus
 Z ( r ) ATD) for dorsal raphé to the selected
ROIs. We also examined changes in functional connectivity of dorsal raphé with
the bilateral dlPFC, and midline sgACC, vmPFC and PCC ROIs. These data are not presented
in Table 2 because none of these regions demonstrated significantly altered functional
connectivity with the dorsal raphé during ATD. 
 
 
 ATD = acute tryptophan depletion; dlPFC = dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; PCC
= posterior cingulate cortex; pgACC = pregenual anterior cingulate cortex; sgACC =
subgenual anterior cingulate cortex; SSRI = selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor;
vmPFC = ventromedial prefrontal cortex.
