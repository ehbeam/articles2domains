decision making under uncertainty. A computational perspective suggests these
deviations arise out of an interaction between distinct valuation systems in the
brain. Here, we provide behavioural data showing that the incidental
presentation of aversive and appetitive conditioned stimuli can alter subjects’
preferences in an economic task, involving a choice between a safe or gamble
option. These behavioural effects informed a model-based analysis of a
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment, involving an identical
paradigm, where we demonstrate that this conditioned behavioral bias engages the
amygdala, a brain structure associated with acquisition and expression of
conditioned associations. Our findings suggest that a well known bias in human
economic choice can arise from an influence of conditioned associations on
goal-directed decision making, consistent with an architecture of choice that
invokes distinct decision-making systems. Research Highlights ►Aversive and appetitive conditioned stimuli can alter subjects’
preferences in an economic choice task. ►These effects are similar to classical,
semantically elicited, framing effects. ►This associative behavioral bias
engages the amygdala. ►Economic biases may reflect obligatory engagement of
Pavlovian response biases associated with reward and
punishment. Keywords Decision making Learning Humans fMRI Amygdala Introduction The idea that humans are optimal decision makers is challenged by
substantial evidence for deviations from rationality during economic decision
making ( Kahneman and Tversky, 1979 ).
Across a variety of contexts, preferences can depend on seemingly arbitrary
factors irrelevant to decision outcomes ( Kahneman et al., 1991; Tversky and Kahneman, 1981,
1986 ). The observation that equivalent biases are observed
in non-human primates ( Chen et al., 2006;
Lakshminaryanan et al., 2008 ), suggests these deviations
may, in part, reflect processes and neural substrates that are strongly
conserved across phylogeny. It is of interest that functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) studies that have probed the neural underpinnings of one form of
decision bias, namely framing, consistently report amygdala activation
( De Martino et al., 2006; Roiser et al.,
2009 ), an evolutionary conserved brain structure implicated
both in emotional learning in humans and other animals ( Phelps and LeDoux, 2005 ). Classical explanations of human decision biases often invoke a dual system
framework pitting a deliberative rational system against an impulsive myopic
affective system ( Camerer et al.,
2005 ). However, psychological and neurobiological data point to a
more complicated architecture, identifying at least three distinct valuation
systems that can compete for control of action. These systems involve Pavlovian,
goal directed and a habitual controllers respectively ( Dayan, 2008; Seymour and Dolan, 2008 ).
The most basic is a Pavlovian system which learns to predict the value of states
and relates these to innate hard-wired behaviour repertoires, such as approach
or withdrawal. A more sophisticated goal-directed system uses an explicit model
of the environment to choose an appropriate course of action to attain a desired
outcome. Finally, the habitual system relies on cached predictions of the
expected reward for the set of all possible actions. This type of decision
architecture can account for otherwise puzzling behaviour as can arise when
there is conflict between Pavlovian and instrumental systems for control of
behavior ( Dayan et al., 2006 ).
Indeed, hints that such influences may be important in human choice behaviour
emerges from previous research showing subjects are more likely to choose an
action if a conditioned cue that has previously been paired with the same
outcome is present ( Bray et al., 2008;
Hogarth et al., 2007; Talmi et al., 2008 ). In this study our aim was to establish whether incidental influences of
conditioned associations, generated through prior conditioning, could elicit a
bias in economic decision making similar in form to that seen when outcomes of
equivalent expected value are described in terms of a loss or a gain, a well
know human bias referred to as ‘framing’. The ‘disease dilemma’ is a popular
example of this effect that requires subjects to choose between two scenarios
relating to the management of an epidemic ( Tversky
and Kahneman, 1981 ). A risky option is fixed, such as ‘Option
A has 2/3 chances to save all 600 affected people,’ but a non-risky option is
presented in either a positive ‘With option B, 400 people will be saved’ or
negative frame ‘With option B, 200 people will die’. A robust finding is that
the probability of choosing the risky option increases when the sure option is
presented in a negative frame. Our experimental paradigm ( Fig. 1 ) alternated two
entirely independent tasks involving either an instrumental conditioning (the
learning task) or an economic decision-making task (the gamble task). We studied
3 separate cohorts of healthy volunteers ( n  = 20, 16, and 20, respectively) in 3
independent experiments. Experiment 3 was performed while we acquired
simultaneous fMRI data with the aim of identifying a neurobiological substrate
to the behavioral effects seen in experiment 1 and 2. Both experiment 1 and 2
differ in the time duration of each trial (shorter in experiment 2) and in
number of sessions (larger in experiment 2), whereas in experiment 2 and 3 the
same protocol was used. This was motivated by a need to adapt and test the
protocol from our initial behavioral experiment (experiment 1) to the fMRI
environment in order to explore its neurobiological underpinnings. We
hypothesized that a bias in decision making during the gamble task engendered by
an incidental presentation of conditioned stimuli would lead to amygdala
activation, an hypothesis motivated by findings that this brain area is
activated in relation to irrational choices in the classical framing effect
( De Martino et al., 2006; Roiser et al.,
2009 ). Materials and methods Subjects A total of 67 healthy and right handed volunteers were recruited for
inclusion in 3 separate experiments: 25 in experiment 1 (13 female, mean
age = 25.2 years,
SD = 4.2 years),
18 in experiment 2 (7 female, mean age = 24.71 years, SD = 4.95), and 24 in experiment 3 (12, female, mean age = 22.2 years, SD = 3.94). Any subject that failed to show gambling
during the task (< 0.5% of their choices) was excluded
from analysis (5 subjects from experiment 1, 2 from experiment 2, and 4 from
experiment 3). The study was conducted with the approval of the University
College London Research Ethics Committee. Experimental paradigm The experiment consisted of two independent alternating tasks, an
instrumental conditioning task and a gamble task. An initial learning phase
involved an instrumental task with monetary outcomes, similar to that used
by  Pessiglione et al. (2006) ,
where a pair of colored fractal images was visually displayed on a monitor
with subjects being required to select one of them with an explicit goal to
maximize their total wins. A total of 3 pairs were used during the entire
experiment: a win pair (generated by appetitive conditioning), a lose pair
(generated by aversive conditioning), and a neutral pair (always followed by
a nil outcome £0). More specifically, each of these pairs was associated
with two outcomes: win £10/£0, lose £10/£0, and £0/£0. For the gain pair,
the probabilities of winning £10/£0 were 0.8/0.2 for one stimulus and
0.2/0.8 for the other. Similarly, in the lose pair, the probabilities of
losing £10/£0 were 0.8/0.2 for one stimulus and 0.2/0.8 for the other.
Subjects were told to learn, by trial and error, stimulus-outcome (reward or
loss) associations for the win and lose pairs. Thus, on each trial, one of
the pairs was randomly presented with the two stimuli displayed right or
left from the centre of the screen (see  Fig. 1 A). The relative position of the stimuli was
counterbalanced across trials. Subjects were required to choose the right or
left stimulus by pressing a right or left arrow on a keyboard in experiment
1 and 2 or by pressing a right or left key in a MRI-compatible keypad in
experiment 3. 2000 ms after the stimuli were presented
(3000 ms in experiment 1) the choice was highlighted
within a red square for 500 ms. Thereafter, the outcome
was displayed on the screen for another 2000 ms, and a
fixation cross was displayed for 500 ms before the
following trial begun. The gamble task was similar to the one used to elicit the framing
effect ( De Martino et al., 2006; Roiser
et al., 2009 ). At the beginning of each trial, subjects
were shown a message for 2000 ms indicating the maximum
amount of money they could win in the trial. Five amounts of winnings were
used in all experiments (£20, £15, £10, £5, £1). Thereafter, subjects were
instructed to make a choice between a win-all/lose-all gamble and a safe
option with equal expected value (with the exception of catch trials, see
below) displayed on the screen for 3000 ms in experiment 1
and for 1500 ms in experiment 2 and 3 (see  Fig. 1 B). To win the maximum amount of
money, participants had to choose the gamble which was represented as a pie
chart depicting the probability of winning the gamble in green and the
probability of losing the gamble in red. A number in bold font, depicted
over the pie chart, indicated the maximum amount of money that could be won
on the gamble. Four different probabilities were used in all experiments
such that the probability of winning the gamble in a given trial was 0.8,
0.6, 0.4, or 0.2. This contrasted with the safe option which paid a portion
of the total amount with probability of 1. The safe option was depicted as a
bold number on the other side of the screen and was superimposed over one of
the fractals used in the learning task comprising a fractal associated with
a high probability of winning (CSwin), one associated with a high
probability of losing (CSlose) or one of the neutral fractals (CS-). The
CS's were never presented under the gamble option since the experimental
question rested on testing whether effects observed in a classical framing
task ( De Martino et al., 2006; Roiser et
al., 2009 ) could be recreated solely by replacement of
the words ‘keep’ and ‘lose’ on the safe option by imposition of conditioned
stimuli (CSwin and CSlose) that signaled a win or loss respectively. The CS-
condition represented a behavioral control condition to enable us to assess
the impact of the learned value, generated by presentation of the CSwin and
CSlose, on a decision to opt for the sure or gamble option in the economic
task. This exact design pertained to each of the 3 separate
experiments. Subjects were not explicitly told the reasoning behind presentation of
fractal stimuli during the economic decision task. In fact, they were told
both tasks were independent. Just as in the instrumental conditioning task,
subjects choose the option on the right or the left by pressing a right or
left arrow on a keyboard in experiment 1 and 2 or by pressing a right or
left key in a MRI-compatible keypad in experiment 3. Trials with different
CSs, maximum amounts and different probabilities of winning the gamble were
randomly intermixed. No feedback concerning trial outcomes was given during
the experiment and subjects were told that, at the end of the experiment,
three trials of the learning task and three trials of the gamble task would
be randomly selected and that they would get paid the selected amount up to
a maximum of £45. Given the equivalence of choices in terms of expected value, we
included ‘catch’ trials to ensure that subjects remained engaged in the
decision-making task throughout the course of the experiment. In these
trials, the expected outcomes for the sure and gamble option were markedly
unbalanced: in half of the trials the gamble option had a 0.95 probability
of winning and was highly preferable and for the other half of the trials
the sure option was preferable since the probability of winning the gamble
was only 0.05. As in the rest of the trials, the sure option was also
displayed over one of the fractals used in the learning task. As illustrated
in  Fig. S4 , subjects were highly
accurate in making optimal decisions in these trials indicating a stable
task engagement. Experiment 1 and 2 were pure behavioral experiments, whereas experiment
3 was performed inside the scanner. In order to get familiarized with the
tasks subjects were given practice and any questions that arose were
answered. After that, subjects performed several trials of the instrumental
conditioning task (learning task): 24 trials of each pair in experiment 1
(7.5 min), and 30 trials of each pair in experiment 2 and 3 (8.5 min). After
these initial trials of the learning task, subjects participated in 2
sessions (19.5 min each) of alternating tasks in experiment 1, and 3
sessions (12.7 min each) of alternating task in experiment 2 and 3. Prior to
a task block subjects were instructed with the name of the task which was
about to begin (learning or gamble task) for 1000 ms. In
each session of the alternating task, 10 trials of the gamble task were
followed by 9 trials of the learning task (3 of each pair) with a total of
80 gamble trials (20 trials with the CSwins, 20 trials with the CSlose, 20
trials with the CS-, and 20 ‘catch’ trials. The order of the trials was
randomized to increase design efficiency. We alternated the two tasks in
order to prevented extinction of the association between the CS and win and
lose outcomes as subjects performed the separate gamble task. At the end of the experiment, subjects were debriefed and asked about
their strategies when performing the task, their awareness of the presence
of the CS from learning task in the gamble task, and whether this
manipulation changed their choice preference in the gamble task. Behavioral data analysis The behavioral data were analyzed using the statistic software SPSS. We
used a 2 way repeated-measures ANOVA with CS (CSwin; CSlose; CS-) and
session (session 1 and session 2 in experiment 1; and session 1, session 2,
and session 3 in experiments 2 and 3) as factors on the percentage of trials
in which subjects chose the gamble option. Computational model The influence of the CS on gamble preference was observed to change as
a function of session in experiment 3. To render our imaging analysis
sensitive to this session effect, and capture the neural underpinnings of
the behavioral effect expressed in the scanning environment, we generated a
parametric regressor of the CS effects on a trial-by-trial basis. We modeled
the learning and the gamble tasks separately. The trial by trial estimates
of the action-state values (Q) for choosing the different stimuli in the
learning task were used to generate biases induced by these stimuli in our
modeling of the gamble task. For completeness, we also applied the model to
the data of experiment 1 and 2 and show these simulations in supplemental
data. Modeling of the learning data For the learning task data, we fitted a standard reinforcement
learning algorithm to each subject's sequence of choices ( Sutton and Barto, 1998 ). We used a
basic Q learning algorithm, as this provides a good account of
instrumental choice in both humans and primates ( O'Doherty, 2004; Pessiglione et al., 2006;
Samejima et al., 2005 ). For each pair of stimuli a
and b, the model estimates the expected value of choosing a
( Q a ) and choosing b
( Q b ), on the basis of
individual sequences of choices and outcomes. This
 Q  value is essentially the expected reward
obtained by taking that particular action (since there are no longer
term consequences of these choices). The  Q  values
were set at zero before learning, and after every trial
 t  > 0
the value of the chosen stimulus (say a) was updated according to the
following rules: Q a t + 1 = Q a t + α * δ t where
 δ ( t ) is the prediction
error: δ t = R t − Q a t for
 R ( t ) being the
reinforcement obtained as an outcome of choosing a at trial
 t . The reinforcement magnitude
 R  was + 10 and −10 for
winning and losing £10, and 0 for those outcomes without any monetary
consequence. Given the  Q  values, the associated
probability of selecting each action (say a) was estimated via the
softmax rule: P a t = exp β * Q a t / (  exp β * Q a t +  exp β * Q b t This is a standard stochastic decision rule that calculates the
probability of taking one out of a set of actions according to their
associated values which has been shown to account for choice behavior in
similar paradigms ( Daw et al., 2006;
Pessiglione et al., 2006 ). The constants
 α i 
(learning rate) and
 β i 
(temperature) were adjusted individually for each subject
( i ) to maximize the likelihood of the actual
observed choices under the model. The mean
 α / β  parameters for the
win and lose pairs, respectively, were 0.2/0.56 and 0.28/0.45 in
experiment 1, 0.11/0.76 and 0.29/0.58 in experiment 2, and 0.26/0.6 and
0.23/0.58 in experiment 3. The individual subjects’ parameters are
reported in  Figs. S7–S9 . These
mean parameters were used to generate the simulations shown in
 Fig. 2 C and  Figs. S5C and
S6C . The mean likelihood of the actual choices under
the model, across all learning trials, was 0.78 in experiment 1, 0.85 in
experiment 2, and 0.83 in experiment 3. As a measure of the quality of
the behavioral fit of the computational model we report a
pseudo- R 2  statistic
( Daw et al., 2006 ) in
 Tables S1-S3 . Modeling of the gamble data For the gamble task data, we fitted each subject's sequence of
choices using a variation of the softmax rule used in the learning task
that accounted for the observed behavioral data. On each trial of the
gamble task there were two options, the safe and the gamble option, with
equal expected value. According to the softmax rule, equivalence in
expected value results in choice indifference. However, each subject
showed a different underlying preference for the gamble and the sure
option which we modeled as a subject-specific parameter
( λ i ,
for subject  i ) added to the value of the sure
option.
 λ i 
would be positive for a risk-averse subject and negative for a
risk-seeking subject. Moreover, as observed in the behavioral data,
subjects’ preference for the gamble or sure option was modified by the
presence of the different CSs, and this effect differed across sessions.
To account for these behavioral observations we added a bias value
( Q cs )
to the expected value of the safe option and weighted it by a second,
subject ( i ) and session
( s )-specific parameter,
 ε is .
 Q cs 
were obtained on a trial by trial basis by modeling the learning task
and were equivalent to the current  Q  value of the
CS displayed under the safe option. Note that although subjects reached
asymptote in the learning task, the
 Q cs  value was not stable
throughout the gamble task as they were dependent on choices in the
learning task that alternated with the gamble task.
 Q CS  value was positive for
CSwin and negative for CSlose, thereby increasing or decreasing the
value of the sure option, an approach similar to that previously
implemented in a model of Pavlovian–instrumental interactions
( Dayan et al.,
2006 ). Since the expected value of both options was equal, we could
simplify the softmax rule and reduce the  β 
parameter or temperature to the
following: P sure t = exp ( ε is * Q cs t + λ i ) / ( exp ( ε is * Q cs t + λ i ) + 1 ) and P gamble t = 1  − P sure t . We calculated the
 λ i 
for each subject using the mean probability of choosing the sure option
in trials where the CS- was displayed under the safe option. Since on
these trials  Q  = 0, λ i = log P sure / 1 − P sure . The constant
 ε is 
was the only parameter that was fitted to maximize the likelihood of the
actual choices under the model, a parameter that we allowed to take on a
different value for each of the modeled sessions. In experiment 1, the
mean  λ  was 0.53, and the mean ε was 0.05 and 0.1
for session 1 and 2, respectively. In experiment 2, the mean
 λ  was 0.41, and the mean ε was − 0.02, 0.03, and 0.07 for session 1, 2 and 3,
respectively. Finally, in experiment 3, the mean
 λ  was 0.15, and the mean ε was −0.01, −0.007,
and 0.03 for session 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The individual subjects’
epsilon parameters are reported in  Figs.
S7–S9 . Note that for experiment 3 the mean ε
parameter only differed from 0 for the last session in line with the
emergence of the key behavioral bias (mean ε in session 1 was −0.01,
 t 19  = 0.7,  p  > 0.1; mean  ε  in
session 2 was −0.007,  t 19  = 0.75,  p  > 0.1; mean  ε 
in session 3 was 0.03,
 t 19  = 2.9,  p  = 0.009). These parameters were used to generate
the simulations shown in  Fig. 2 C and  Figs. S5C and
S6C . The mean likelihood of the actual choices under the model, across
all gamble trials, was 0.61 in experiment 1, 0.58 in experiment 2, and
0.57 in experiment 3. As a measure of the quality of the behavioral fit
of the computational model we report a
pseudo- R 2  statistic
( Daw et al., 2006 ) in
 Tables S1-S3 . We
acknowledge that a lack of alternative models with which to compare the
model fit precludes any strong conclusion about the computational
implementation of this specific model. Moreover, the mean and individual
pseudo- R 2  reveals that this
is clearly not a good model for the subjects' behavior: in many subjects
the pseudo- R 2  is virtually 0 and
in some cases it is even slightly negative indicating that a model of
random choice can perform better. However, our intention in using this
model was solely to capture key features of the influence of the CS's on
decision making, namely differences in probability of gambling according
to whether a CS displayed under the safe option was associated with wins
or loses in the learning task. Moreover, because the model allowed us to
construct a parametric regressor of the CS effect on the gamble task in
fMRI data analysis, this had the added value of increasing the power of
our analysis. Image acquisition and analysis For experiment 3, we performed fMRI on a 3-Tesla Siemens Allegra
magnetic resonance scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with echo planar
imaging (EPI). In the functional session 48 T2*-weighted
images per volume (covering whole head) with blood oxygenation
level-dependent (BOLD) contrast were obtained (matrix: 64 × 64; 48 oblique axial slices per volume angled at
−30° in the antero-posterior axis; spatial resolution: 3 × 3 × 3 mm; TR = 2880 ms; TE = 30 ms). The fMRI acquisition protocol was optimized to reduce
susceptibility-induced BOLD sensitivity losses in inferior frontal and
temporal lobe regions ( Weiskopf et al.,
2006 ). For each subject functional data were acquired in
three scanning sessions containing 260 volumes per session. Six additional
volumes at the beginning of each series were acquired to allow for steady
state magnetization and were subsequently discarded. Anatomical images of
each subject's brain were collected using T1 weighted sequences (spatial
resolution: 1 × 1 × 1 mm). Additionally, individual
field maps were recorded using a double echo FLASH sequence (matrix
size = 64 × 64; 64 slices; spatial resolution = 3 × 3 × 3 mm; gap = 1 mm; short TE = 10 ms; long TE = 12.46 ms; TR = 1020 ms) for distortion
correction of the acquired EPI images ( Weiskopf
et al., 2006 ). Using the ‘FieldMap toolbox’
( Hutton et al., 2002 ) field
maps were estimated from the phase difference between the images acquired at
the short and long TE. Pre-processing included realignment, unwrapping using individual
fieldmaps, and finally spatial normalizing to the Montreal Neurology
Institute (MNI) space and smoothing with a 4 mm Gaussian
kernel. The fMRI time series data were high-pass filtered (cutoff = 128 s) and whitened
using an AR(1)-model. For each subject a statistical model was computed by
applying a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) combined with time
and dispersion derivatives ( Friston et al.,
1998 ). At the first level model all sessions were concatenated and the
following 4 conditions of interest were modeled as events at the onset of
the trial: trials in which subjects chose the sure option where the CSwin
was displayed under the safe option (Sure/CSwin), trials in which subjects
chose the gamble option where the CSwin was displayed under the safe option
(Gamble/CSwin), trials in which subjects chose the sure option where the
CSlose was displayed under the safe option (Sure/CSlose), and trials in
which subjects chose the gamble option where the CSlose was displayed under
the safe option (Gamble/CSlose). As parametric modulator for each of the
above regressors we used, on each trial,
 ε*|Q CS | 
derived from fitting the computational model to each individual's data.
These parametric modulators were based on a group-wise model fit. This
allowed us to index brain activity that scaled with the strength of the
observed behavioral bias in a 2 × 2 factorial design with decision (gamble
or sure) and CS as main factors. We also modeled separately the following
regressors of no interest: trials in which subjects chose the safe option
and the CS- was displayed under the safe option, trials in which subjects
chose the gamble option and the CS- was displayed under the safe option, the
catch trials, and each of the pairs of the learning task that were
alternated among the gamble trials. Finally, to capture residual
movement-related artifacts six covariates (the three rigid-body translation
and three rotations resulting from realignment) were also included as
regressors of no interest. As described, the primary aim of our neuroimaging analysis was to
capture brain areas mediating the observed bias in decision making induced
by a display under the safe option of either the CSwin or the CSlose
predictive conditioned stimuli. The interaction contrast [(Sure/CSwin + Gamble/CSlose) − (Gamble/CSwin + Sure/CSlose)] of our parametric
regressors captures this effect and allows for identification of brain areas
that show high activity when subjects chose the safe option when the CSwin
is displayed and when they chose the gamble option when the CSlose is
displayed (see  Fig. 1 B). In other
words our focus is on choices that account for the observed bias.
Critically, a two by two interaction contrast is balanced with respect to
the two main effects such that brain activity in the interaction contrast is
uncontaminated by effects attributable to either the decision (safe or
gamble option) or the valence associated with the CS (win or lose).
Moreover, our parametric regressor weights this simple interaction by a
session specific parameter that relates to the magnitude of the behavioral
impact of CS's on the decision-making process. Therefore, by using a
parametric regressor we test for brain areas supporting the emergence of a
CS induced bias with the progression of the experiment. Parameter estimates were used to calculate the interaction contrast for
each individual subject. These contrast images were entered into a second
level one-sample  t -test across subjects (random
effects analysis). Our a priori hypothesis pointed to the amygdala as the
most likely candidate to mediate biases induced by presentation of CSs.
First, activation of the amygdala has been found in two previous experiments
studying the framing effect which is analogous to the biases that we want to
explain with the present experiment ( De
Martino et al., 2006; Roiser et al., 2009 ). Moreover, a
substantial animal literature has established the amygdala as important in
the acquisition and expression of conditioned behaviors regardless of the
valence of the CSs ( Balleine and Killcross,
2006; Cardinal et al., 2002 ). Therefore, we restricted
our primary analysis of interest to regions subsumed within an inclusive
mask derived from an independent data set that found amygdala activation
mediating the framing effect in subjects carrying the ss variant of the
5HTT-linked polymorphic region ( Roiser et al.,
2009 ). To build this mask we used the contrast image
obtained in this previous study and thresholded it to
 p  < 0.001.
This mask only includes the left amygdala. If we assume that in the present
experiment we are studying the same phenomenon as in Roiser et al., the
laterality of the effects would be expected to be the same. Post hoc, we
determined whole brain effects in our experiment, primarily for descriptive
purposes, where the resulting z statistic images from the second level
analysis were thresholded at  p  < 0.005 and reported in the supplementary
 Table S4 . Significant
activations are displayed by superimposition of the SPM maps on our group
templates in  Fig. 4  and
 Fig. S10 . Results Cue induced biases in economic decision
making During the learning task, prior to the actual gamble task, subjects had
learned to choose the fractal associated with an 80% probability of winning
£10 and to avoid the fractal associated with an 80% probability of losing
£10 ( Fig. 3 A and  Figs. S5A and
S6A ). Subjects were explicitly told that both tasks were
independent and indeed, most subjects reported that the CS's displayed under
the safe option did not induce a bias in their decisions (15/20 in
experiment 1; 12/14 in experiment 2; and 19/20 in experiment 3). Subjects’ choices in the gamble task were affected by the presence of
the incidental conditioned fractal images, that predicted losses and wins in
the separate learning task, in all three experiments ( Fig. 2  and  Figs.
S1–S3 ), a finding analogous in form to what we found in
previous experiments on framing ( De
Martino et al., 2006; Roiser et al., 2009 ).
Specifically, in experiment 1 and 2 we found a main effect of CS
( F (2,38) = 3.94;  P  = 0.046 l for experiment 1; and
 F (2,26) = 4.34;  P  = 0.042
for experiment 2), without any significant main effect of session
( F (1,38) = 0.89;  p  > 0.1 for experiment 1; and  F (2,26) = 1.59;  p  > 0.1 for experiment 2) or CS by session
interaction ( F (2,38) = 2.5;  p  > 0.1 for experiment 1; and
 F (2,26) = 1.87;  p  > 0.1 for experiment 2). Importantly, these effects had a valence
directionality evident by an increased preference for the gamble option when
the CS loss stimulus was presented with the sure option and a decreased
preference for the gamble option when the CSwin was displayed under the sure
option (For experiment 1: CSwin versus CSlose,
 t 19  = 2.47,  p  = 0.023; CSwin versus CS-,
 t 19  = 1.48,  p  > 0.1; CSlose versus CS-,
 t 19  = 2.57,  p  = 0.019; for experiment 2: CSwin versus CSlose,
t 13  = 2.37,
 p  = 0.034;
CSwin versus CS-, t 13  = 1.67,  p  > 0.1; CSlose versus CS-,  t 19  = 2.04,  p  = 0.062). In experiment 3, although we did not observed any main effect of CS
( F (2,38) = 0.47;  p  > 0.1) or session ( F (2,38) = 3.2;  p  > 0.1), we observed a significant session by CS interaction
( F (4,76) = 4.83;  P  = 0.004). This interaction reflected the emergence of the same pattern of
conditioned stimulus induced preferences, that we observed in experiment 1
and 2, by the third session (CSwin versus CSlose in last session,
 t 19  = 3.46,  p  = 0.003; CSwin versus CS- in last session,
 t 19  = 0.9,  p  > 1; CSlose versus CS- in last session,
 t 19  = 2.19,  p  = 0.041). Together with the emergence of the behavioral bias in
session 3, we also found that subjects became gradually faster at making
their decisions from session 1 to 3 as shown by a session effect on reaction
time data (mean reaction time across conditions was 896.6 ms, 864.7 ms, and 810.1 ms for
sessions 1, 2, and 3, respectively;  F (2,38) = 20.2;  p  < 0.001; in the lack of CS or session by
CS interaction (F2,38) = 0.5;
 p  > 0.1;
and  F (4,76) = 1.6;  p  > 0.1). Although we did not find any session or session by CS interaction in
experiment 1 and 2, the effects of CS were stronger in the last session for
each experiment: when the effects of CS were looked separately for each
session, an effect of CS on the probability of gambling was only observed in
the last session of each experiment. Details in relation to how this effect
evolved across sessions are detailed in  Figs.
S1–S3 . The source of the observed bias in the gamble task induced by the
presence of the CSs cannot be accounted for by an effect on task difficulty
since the presence of the different CS's did not influence subjects’
reaction times for their decisions (Experiment 1: CSwin, 1503.9 ms; CSlose, 1487.3 ms; CS-, 1496.8 ms; main effect of CS  F (2,38) = 0.155, n.s.; Experiment 2: CSwin,
869.5 ms; CSlose, 890.9 ms; CS-,
883.8 ms; main effect of CS
 F (2,26) = 1.14, n.s.; Experiment 3: CSwin, 858.4 ms; CSlose,
860.9 ms; CS-, 852.1 ms; main effect
of CS  F (2,38) = 0.5; n.s.). Moreover, subjects’ attention to the task persisted throughout
the entire experiment evident in the fact that they made accurate choices
according to the expected value of the different options in catch trials
( Fig. S4 ). Amygdala activation and expression of behavioral
biases We found left amygdala [Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space
coordinates (x,y,z) −20,4,−16; peak Z score = 3.27;  p  = 0.001 uncorrected;  p  = 0.015  FWE ] ( Fig. 4 )
expressed a significant interaction between decision (gamble or not) and the
parameter
 ε*|Q CS | ,
which indicated the magnitude of the effect of the CS on the decision
process. The left amygdala was activated in conditions where the presence of
the CSlose under the sure option biased subjects to choose the gamble option
and where the CSwin under the sure option biased subjects away from the
gamble option. Although the mask that we used only included the left
amygdala, we did not observe any activation in the right amygdala when
performing an exploratory analysis at a more liberal threshold, suggesting
that in the present experiment the amygdala response showed a left-sided
laterality, as found previously in an fMRI study of the framing effect
( Roiser et al., 2009 ). For
descriptive purposes, we also determined post hoc whole brain effects of
this interaction contrast ( p  < 0.005 uncorrected, supplementary  Table S4 ). Remarkably, we also found a large
cluster of activation in the right ventral striatum (anterior caudate) [MNI
space coordinates12, 22, 0; peak Z score = 3.34;  p  < 0.001, uncorrected]. Discussion We show that the incidental presentation of stimuli that predict wins and
losses can bias independent economic decision making under uncertainty. These
influences of conditioned stimuli we observe is similar to an influence elicited
by mere presentation of gain and lose semantic frames as seen in classical
framing experiments. Moreover, the emergence of this bias was related to
amygdala activation which shows that the striking similarity between the
behavioral effects, observed with the present paradigm and classical framing
effects, also extends to its neurobiological underpinnings. It is known that reward and punishment conditioned stimuli generate
approach and withdrawal responses towards the stimuli (see  Everitt et al., 2003; Kim and Jung,
2006 ) for reviews in appetitive and aversive conditioning,
respectively). The increased preference towards the gamble option when the
CSlose was presented under the sure option can be conceived of as a withdrawal
from a stimulus that predicts a loss. On the other hand, the decreased
preference towards the gamble option observed when the CSwin was presented under
the sure option can be conceived of as enhanced approach to a stimulus that has
been learned to predict wins. Therefore, we suggest that after learning an
association between stimuli and outcome through instrumental conditioning in the
learning task, the CSwin and the CSlose generate expectations of reward and
punishment. These automatically access a Pavlovian system, which triggers an
associated unconditioned response such as approach or withdrawal which we
suggest is the mechanism by which the CSs induce the observed decision biases in
the unrelated gamble task. Note that although our training task was instrumental it is widely accepted
that the type of conditioning we implemented involves both Pavlovian and
instrumental mechanisms ( Kim and Jung, 2006;
Mackintosh, 1983 ). We are aware that it is difficult to
disentangle what is purely Pavlovian or instrumental in our experimental
setting. However, in the critical test phase it was the mere presence of these
predictive stimuli, without a requirement to perform a learnt action that was
critical to the decision biasing effect we observed. This behavioral effect is
then reminiscent of a Pavlovian instrumental transfer (PIT) experiments in which
the amount of responses in an instrumental task to obtain reward is increased by
the mere presentation of a conditioned stimulus that has been learned to predict
reward ( Lovibond, 1983 ) and the
instrumental response to avoid punishment is increased by the mere presentation
of a conditioned stimulus that has been learned to predict punishment
( Overmier et al.,
1971 ). The involvement of the amygdala in generating decision biases points to a
key role for the Pavlovian system, a system also implicated in sign tracking
( Parkinson et al., 2000 ), fear
conditioning ( Phelps and LeDoux,
2005 ), the generation of Pavlovian to instrumental interactions
including conditioned reinforcement ( Burns et al.,
1993 ) and an invigorating effect on instrumental actions
( Hall et al., 2001; Talmi et al.,
2008 ). The overarching role of the Pavlovian system in these
diverse contexts can be conceptualised in terms of information provision in
relation to motivational state to an otherwise motivationally less flexible
habitual system ( Dayan and Balleine,
2002 ). We acknowledge that other brain areas may also be
implicated in the observed effects. However, our a priori hypothesis was
restricted to the amygdala and as shown by our exploratory analysis the caudate
and the insula were also activated in the expression of the decision bias driven
by the conditioned fractal images. Indeed, the striatum is a key brain area
implicated in the expression of Pavlovian/instrumental interactions in animals
( Cardinal et al., 2002 ) and humans
( Talmi et al., 2008 ). It has been
suggested that the neural mechanism that generates Pavlovian/instrumental
interactions requires translation of an affective signal, mediated by amygdala,
to processes implemented in the striatum. One potential mechanism by which this
could be achieved is through amygdala projections to the dopaminergic midbrain
that would then modulate neuronal processing in the striatum ( Balleine and Killcross, 2006; Cardinal et al.,
2002 ). It is of interest that the impact of conditioned stimuli in experiment 3
became stronger as the experiment progressed. As subjects become more
experienced with the gamble task they are likely to rely more on habitual or
automated mechanisms in making their decisions, a context where the influences
of conditioned associations on instrumental performance is known to be more
robust ( Dickinson and Balleine,
2001 ). As the habitual system does not use an explicit model of
the outcomes of actions, the Pavlovian and instrumental representations of value
interact more closely when a behavior becomes habitual, resulting in larger PIT
effects when subjects rely more on habitual mechanisms to make decisions in the
gamble task. A general view on habit formation assumes that behavior begins as
goal directed but becomes habitual through reinforcement in a stable
environment. For example, after habituation has taken place, the behavior is no
longer influenced by outcome devaluation, a hallmark of goal directedness
( Dickinson & Balleine, 2001 ).
Although subjects were never reinforced in the gamble task, the latency effect,
where subjects became gradually faster at making decisions from session 1 to 3,
is consistent with findings from skill learning that performing an action many
times, even without receiving explicit reinforcement, leads to this action
becoming automated, as expressed in habit ( Doyon et
al., 2003 ). Therefore, our data supports the suggestion that
subjects’ decision process became more automated as the task progressed and
thereby become more susceptible to conditioned influences. In experiment 1 and 2
the behavioral bias elicited by the CS was much stronger and observed over all
sessions without any apparent interaction with session. In the context of
scanning this behavioral effect showed an interaction with session, and was only
significant at a group level during the third session. However, we also observed
in both our preliminary behavioral studies (experiments 1 and 2) that the effect
of the CS on decision making became stronger as the experiment progressed.
Whereas experiment 1 and 2 were performed inside normal experimental rooms,
experiment 3 was carried out inside the scanner and this change in environment
may well explain the differences in the emergent pattern of behavior seen across
the three different experiments. For example, the novelty and ambient noise of
the scanner environment may have delayed the emergence of a more habit based
approach to performing the gamble task. Our data provides convergent behavioral and neurobiological evidence that a
bias in decision making reflects the dominance of a Pavlovian valuation system
on goal-directed decision making under uncertainty. Incidental stimuli that
predict losses and wins in an entirely different context to that of the gamble
task, appear to have generated avoidance and approach tendencies with respect to
the sure option and, in so doing, distorted subjects’ behavioural preferences.
These distortions result in a context bias identical in form to that reported in
the framing effect ( De Martino et al., 2006;
Roiser et al., 2009 ). The fact that framing tasks use
emotionally laden words, such as ‘lose’ and ‘win,’ semantics known to generate
approach and avoidance tendencies ( Chen and Bargh,
1999 ), supports our suggestion that decision biases can arise
solely out of a conditioned effect. Although our computational model also
supports this view, the modelling results need to be taken with caution because
alternative models have not been tested and the model fit to the data is often
suboptimal. In terms of mechanisms we suggest that Pavlovian action tendencies
approach or avoid, generated by stimuli that predict wins or losses bias the
level of control exercised by an instrumental system that, rationally, should
not care about these irrelevant stimuli. Emotional laden words whose meaning has
been experienced repeatedly over the entire lifespan may act as much stronger
conditioned association than our fractal images that were newly associated with
their respective outcomes. This could potentially explain why the standard
framing effect as studied with manipulations of the wording of the different
choice options is much stronger than the effects that we observed and can be
seen after a single presentation ( Kahneman et al., 1991; Tversky and Kahneman, 1981, 1986 ).
Although in the present work we show how the Pavlovian system can be a source of
distortion in economic decision making, it is worth noting that these kind of
biases are likely to be of evolutionary benefit in so far as they are conserved
across phylogeny where they are likely to provide, on average, reliable
predictions about expected reward and punishments in situations of
uncertainty. References Balleine B.W. Killcross S. Parallel incentive processing: an integrated view of

 Fig. S4 Behavioral results for catch trials in all
experiments. In these trials (25% of all gamble trials) the
expected outcome of the safe and gamble option was markedly
unbalanced. In half of these trials (depicted in yellow) the
safe option had higher expected outcome as the probability of
winning the gamble was only 0.05. In the other half of these
trials (depicted in blue) the gamble option had higher expected
outcome as the probability of winning the gamble was 0.95. The
plots show the probability of choosing the gamble in these
trials for each of the CS depicted under the safe option. The
subjects were highly accurate in making optimal choices in these
trials, providing evidence of continued engagement with the task
throughout the experiment.

each of the CS displayed under the sure option in each session,
shows that the preference for the gamble when the safe option

effect of CS ( F (2,38) = 3.94;  P  = 0.046l) and the session by CS
interaction only shows a trend:
 F (2,38) = 2.5;  P  = 0.095). ( C ) The

conditioning or learning task and the financial decision making or gamble task.
Time is displayed in milliseconds. (A) On learning trials, two colored fractals
were presented on the screen; subjects selected one of them, and subsequently
observed the outcome. There were 3 pairs: a win, a loss, and neutral pair. In
this example, the chosen fractal was associated with losing £10 or losing
nothing with 0.8 and 0.2 probabilities, respectively. (B) Each gamble trial
began with a message showing the maximum amount of money that could be won in
the trial, followed by a choice between a win-all/lose-all gamble (displayed
here on the right as a chart pie) and a safe option with equal expected
outcomes. The safe option was depicted as a bold number over one a fractal from
the learning task: the one associated with 0.8 probability of winning (CSwin),
the one associated with 0.8 probability of losing (CSlose), or a neutral fractal
(CS-). Subjects were not explicitly told about this manipulation and both tasks
were explained as independent of each other. No feedback was provided concerning
trial outcomes. Fig. 2 Behavioral results. This figure displays mean percentage of trials
in which subjects chose the gamble option for each of the CS's displayed under
the safe option. Error bars indicate SEM. Post hoc comparisons were implemented
by means of repeated-measures  t -test: *
 P  < 0.05;
** P  < 0.005.
(A) Outside the scanner, subjects showed an increased preference for the gamble
option when the CS loss stimulus was presented with the sure option and a
decreased preference when the CSwin was displayed during the whole experiment.
(B) Outside the scanner, this effect was stronger during the last session of the
experiment. (C) Inside the scanner, the emergence of the behavioral effect was
not evident if all sessions were considered together. (D) Inside the scanner,
the behavioral effect and became only evident during the third
session. Fig. 3 Observed and modeled results in experiment 3. (A) The observed
learning curves depict, trial by trial, the proportion of subjects that chose
the fractal with highest probability of monetary win (win pair) in blue, with
highest probability of monetary lose (lose pair) in red, and a given fractal
without any monetary outcome (neutral pair) in grey. The numbers in the x axis
highlights the beginning of each session alternating gamble and learning task.
(B) The probability of gambling for each of the CS displayed under the sure
option in each session, shows that the preference for the gamble when the safe
option was displayed over the CSwin decreased over sessions, whereas the
preference for the gamble when the safe option was displayed over the CSlose
increased. (C) The modeled learning curves depict, trial by trial, the
probabilities of choices as simulated by a computational model based on a
group-wise model fit. (D) Probability of gambling simulated by the computational
model for each of the CS displayed under the sure option in each
session. Fig. 4 fMRI results. (A) Interaction of parametric regressors

activation reflecting the emergence of the CS induced bias with the progression
of the experiment, namely choosing the gamble option when the CS loss is
presented and choosing the safe option when CSwin is presented over the safe
option and weighted by a session specific parameter that relates to the
magnitude of the behavioral impact of CS's on the decision making process. This
analysis was constrained by an inclusive mask using a similar interaction
derived from an independent data set that found amygdala activation for
behavioral biases in decision making (see text for details). A cluster of highly
significant activation was observed within this mask in the left amygdala (peak
