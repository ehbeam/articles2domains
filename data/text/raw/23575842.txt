 Dorsal anterior cingulate and bilateral anterior insula form a task control network (TCN) whose primary function includes initiating and maintaining task-level cognitive set and exerting top-down regulation of sensorimotor processing. The default mode network (DMN), comprising an anatomically distinct set of cortical areas, mediates introspection and self-referential processes. Resting-state data show that TCN and DMN interact. The functional ramifications of their interaction remain elusive. Recording fMRI data from human subjects performing a visual spatial attention task and correlating Granger causal influences with behavioral performance and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity we report three main findings. First, causal influences from TCN to DMN, i.e., TCN→DMN, are positively correlated with behavioral performance. Second, causal influences from DMN to TCN, i.e., DMN→TCN, are negatively correlated with behavioral performance. Third, stronger DMN→TCN are associated with less elevated BOLD activity in TCN, whereas the relationship between TCN→DMN and DMN BOLD activity is unsystematic. These results suggest that during visual spatial attention, top-down signals from TCN to DMN regulate the activity in DMN to enhance behavioral performance, whereas signals from DMN to TCN, acting possibly as internal noise, interfere with task control, leading to degraded behavioral performance.

 Introduction 
 The task control network (TCN) and the default mode network (DMN) are two fundamental cortical systems. Consistently activated in a wide variety of cognitive paradigms, TCN, containing dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and bilateral anterior insula (AI) ( Dosenbach et al., 2006 ), initiates and maintains task-level control, selects appropriate sensorimotor mapping, and suppresses irrelevant distracting information ( Logan and Gordon, 2001 ;  Kerns et al., 2004 ;  Botvinick et al., 2004 ;  Dosenbach et al., 2006 ;  Corbetta et al., 2008 ;  Sridharan et al., 2008 ;  Nelson et al., 2010 ;  Fan et al., 2011 ). In contrast, consistently deactivated in cognitive paradigms demanding externally oriented attention, DMN, containing posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), ventral and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), bilateral inferior parietal lobe, and lateral temporal cortex ( Buckner et al., 2008 ), mediates internal mentation and self-referencing, and underlies emotional regulation ( Maddock, 1999 ;  Simpson et al., 2001 ) and mind wandering ( Mason et al., 2007 ). Resting-state BOLD signals from these two networks are anti-correlated ( Greicius and Menon, 2004 ;  Fox et al., 2005 ;  Dosenbach et al., 2008 ;  Ding et al., 2009 ;  Fitzgerald et al., 2010 ;  Smallwood et al., 2012 ), suggesting interaction, but the functional significance of this interaction remains to be understood. 
 According to a recent theory TCN maintains task control over other brain areas by issuing top-down signals to regulate their activities ( Dosenbach et al., 2006 ). In the theory’s current formulation, areas receiving these regulatory signals are mainly task-positive areas, namely areas activated during external tasks ( Fox et al., 2005 ); task-negative areas (deactivated), despite the clear functional necessity that their activities be regulated according to task conditions ( Sambataro et al., 2008 ;  van Eimeren et al., 2009 ;  Ossandón et al., 2011 ;  Sharp et al., 2011 ), are not considered. Recent data suggest that the activities of task-negative areas may be regulated by TCN as well ( Gao et al., 2012 ;  Ossandón et al., 2011 ). Clinically, disrupted functional connectivity between DMN and executive control structures including TCN regions ( Church et al., 2009 ;  Spreng and Schacter, 2011 ,  Sato et al., 2012 ) or damaged structural connectivity between TCN nodes ( Bonnelle et al., 2012 ) are thought to partly underlie the dysregulation of DMN activity in brain disorders. These evidences appear to support the extension of TCN’s domain of influence to include DMN. Our first goal is to test this hypothesis. 
 DMN activity fluctuates slowly. During the elevated phase of DMN activity, particularly in its midline regions (mDMN), task performance deteriorates ( Spreng and Schacter, 2011 ). This may be understood by viewing mDMN as a source of internal interference or noise ( Greicius and Menon, 2004 ;  Buckner et al., 2008 ;  Smallwood et al., 2012 ). Supporting this view, PCC and MPFC have been identified as chiefly responsible for attentional lapses and mind wandering ( Mason et al., 2007 ;  Christoff et al., 2009 ;  Anticevic et al., 2010 ). In brain disorders, mDMN regions are less deactivated relative to controls in cognitive tasks, contributing to cognitive deficits ( van Eimeren et al., 2009 ;  Santhanam et al., 2011 ;  Bonnelle et al., 2012 ). Less suppressed DMN may disrupt task performance by issuing signals to interfere with the control set maintained by TCN. The testing of this hypothesis is our second goal. 
 These goals were accomplished by collecting fMRI data from human subjects performing a visual spatial attention experiment. General Linear Modeling (GLM) and independent component analysis (ICA) were applied to identify regions of interest (ROIs) in TCN and DMN. Their directional influences were then assessed by Granger causality and correlated with accuracy, reaction time, and BOLD activity level. 
 
 
 Materials and Methods 
 
 Experiment 
 Thirteen healthy right-handed individuals with normal or corrected-to-normal vision participated in the study. The experimental protocol, which included both resting-state and task fMRI, was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Beijing Normal University. One male subject failed to perform the attention task according to instructions and was not included in further analysis. 
 Resting-state was recorded first, in which subjects were instructed to relax with their eyes closed for 10 minutes. The visual spatial attention experiment followed, which consisted of 12 attention blocks and 12 passive view blocks. The experimental timeline is schematically illustrated in  Figure 1A . In attention blocks (labeled A blocks), each trial started with a cue, instructing the subject to initiate and maintain covert attention to the left or right hemifield. Following a 2500ms delay, a standard or a target stimulus of 100ms in duration appeared either inside the attended hemifield (valid trial) or inside the unattended hemifield (invalid trial). The subject was required to make a speedy key-press response only to the target stimulus when it appeared in the cued hemifield. The standard stimulus appeared 80% of the time with 50% validity and the target stimulus appeared 20% of the time with 50% validity. In passive view blocks (labeled B blocks), the schedule of stimulus presentation remained the same, but neither attention nor response was required; the subject simply maintained fixation. The two types of blocks were arranged in an ABBA or BAAB order in each run (session). For each participant, three ABBA runs and three BAAB runs were arranged in an interleaved fashion. Each block lasted 60s (15 trials), with 20s fixation intervals inserted between successive blocks. More details of the paradigm can be found in  Wen et al. (2012a) . 
 
 
 Data acquisition and preprocessing 
 MRI scanning was performed on a 3-Tesla Siemens Magnetom Trio whole-body MRI system (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) at the Beijing Normal University MRI Center. The functional scans were acquired with a T2*-weighed echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence (echo time (TE), 30ms; repetition time (TR), 2000ms; flip angle, 90°), with 33 axial slices in each volume (field of view, 200×200mm 2 ; matrix size, 64×64; slice thickness, 3.60mm, giving a voxel size=3.13×3.13×3.60mm 3 ). There were 300 whole-brain volumes for the resting state session and 180 whole-brain volumes for each of the 6 task runs. High-resolution anatomic images were acquired with a T1-weighted 128 slice MPRAGE sequence (TR, 2530 ms; TE, 3.39 ms; flip angle, 7°; inversion time, 1100 ms and voxel size=1×1.33×1mm 3 ). 
 Functional MRI data were preprocessed using SPM2 ( http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/ ). The steps included slice timing, motion correction, coregistration to the individual’s anatomical image, normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template ( Friston et al., 1995 ), and re-sampling into a 3×3×3 mm 3  per voxel resolution. For General Linear Model (GLM) analysis and independent component analysis (ICA), spatial-smoothing of normalized images was done with an 8mm FWHM (Full Width at Half Maximum) Gaussian core. (Note that spatial-smoothing was not done for Granger causality analysis as explained below.) Global scaling was applied to remove the global signal before GLM analysis. Although how to remove the global signal is likely to be problem-specific ( Aguirre et a., 1998 ;  Gavrilescu et al., 2002 ;  Junghöfer et al., 2005 ;  Macey et al. 2004 ;  Zarahn et al. 1997 ), we found that for our data, global scaling made the BOLD time series from activated regions more correlated with the task design, and provided more precise activation results, in line with many previous studies ( Birn et al. 2006 ;  Lund et al., 2006 ;  Fox et al., 2009 ). Additionally, the removal of global signal made the residual BOLD time series more stationary ( Rogers et al., 2007 ;  Sridharan et al., 2007 ), which is required by Granger causality analysis. 
 
 
 Task activation and regions of interest 
 For the attention task, two kinds of regressors, one corresponding to the attention condition and one the passive view condition, were used to fit the GLM. Each regressor was generated by convolving the blocked rectangular function corresponding to a given experimental condition with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF). In the random-effects analysis, for each subject, from the fitted GLM model, the attend condition and the passive view condition were compared to produce the contrast image. These contrast images were fed into a GLM that implemented a one-sample t-test to yield group-level activations. False Discovery Rate (FDR) control was applied to correct for multiple comparisons ( Bennett et al., 2009 ;  Poldrack et al., 2009 ). ROIs for TCN were generated by intersecting the group activated regions (T>5.20, p<0.002, FDR corrected) with spheres of 5 mm in radius centered at the voxels with maxima local T values (T>8.24, p<0.0002, FDR corrected). 
 ROIs for DMN were identified by applying group ICA analysis to resting-state data. Twenty five aggregate independent components (ICs) were identified using the GIFT toolbox ( http://icatb.sourceforge.net/ ) where the number of components was determined by the Minimum Description Length (MDL) criterion. All aggregate ICs were visually inspected, and the IC representing DMN was selected ( Buckner et al., 2008 ). Midline DMN ROIs were generated by intersecting the group ICA map (T>4.75, p<0.005, FDR corrected) with spheres of 5 mm in radius centered at the voxels with maxima local T values (T>8.24, p<0.0002, FDR corrected) in the midline regions of the ICA map. 
 
 
 Granger causality analysis 
 Testing of our hypotheses requires that neuronal interactions be decomposed into their directional components. We chose Granger causality for this purpose due to its simplicity, its demonstrated effectiveness, and our extensive experience with the method ( Ding et al., 2006 ;  Bollimunta et al., 2008 ;  2011 ;  Wen et al., 2012a ). Its basic idea is that if the history of one time series can be used to facilitate the prediction of the future of another time series then we say there is a Granger causal influence from the former to the latter ( Granger, 1967 ). Recent work applying this method to fMRI data has offered useful insights into the functional organization of both healthy and diseased brain networks ( Rypma et al., 2006 ;  Abler et al., 2006 ;  Sridharan et al., 2007 ;  Bressler et al., 2008 ;  Hamilton et al., 2010 ;  Liao et al., 2010 ;  Jiao et al., 2011 ;  Miao et al., 2011 ;  Ge et al., 2012 ;  Wen et al., 2012a ). 
 The analysis protocol has five steps ( Wen et al., 2012a ) ( Figure 2A ). First, for each voxel in a given ROI, the fMRI time series prior to spatial smoothing was extracted from the normalized functional images and the global signal were removed ( Smith et al., 1999 ) using the SPM2 global scaling function ( http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/ ). The reason for extracting individual voxel time series before spatial smoothing is because spatial smoothing or averaging within ROI may run the risk of losing valuable temporal information critical for Granger causality analysis. Second, the mean signal value during the baseline fixation period (F period in  Figure 1A ) was calculated, and the percentage BOLD signal change was obtained by subtracting the mean signal value from the fMRI time series and then dividing the difference by the mean signal value. This step, while not required for Granger causality analysis, helps with the normalization and comparison of data ( Figure 2B ). Third, for each voxel, the data of the 12 attention blocks were averaged to obtain the average task response ( Figure 2B ). This average task response was subtracted from each attention block to yield the block-level residual BOLD fluctuation time series ( Figure 2C ). Fourth, for the block-level BOLD residual time series, the first 5 time points (10 seconds) were discarded ( Garrett et al., 2011 ) to eliminate the transient effects, and the temporal mean was removed in order to meet the zero-mean requirement assumed by the autoregressive (AR) model ( Ding et al., 2000 ;  Ding et al., 2006 ). The temporal-mean-removed residual time series, containing 25 time points, were treated as realizations of an underlying stochastic process. Fifth, for a given pair of ROIs, Granger causality was calculated on the zero-mean residual time series following Geweke’s formulation ( Geweke, 1982 ;  Ding et al., 2006 ) for all pairwise combinations of voxels between the two ROIs and averaged ( Wen et al., 2012a ). Based on Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) the order of AR model was determined to be 1 ( Roebroeck et al., 2005 ;  Bressler et al., 2008 ;  Hamilton et al., 2010 ;  Wen et al., 2012a ). 
 Granger causality requires that the time series be approximately stationary ( Ding et al., 2006 ). We tested the stationarity of block-level residual BOLD time series using the KPSS test ( Kwiatkowski et al., 1992 ) and found that 99% of the time series passed the test. To examine how well the AR models captured the temporal structure in the BOLD data we applied the Durbin-Watson test ( Durbin and Watson, 1950 ) to the innovation series from each of the estimated AR models ( Seth, 2005 ). Ninety nine percent of the pairwise models passed the test. 
 
 
 Linking causal influences with behavior 
 Behavioral performance in each attention block was assessed by accuracy and reaction time (RT) ( Wen et al, 2012a ). Accuracy was defined as the ratio between the number of correctly performed trials and the total number of trials. Correctly performed trials were the trials where the subject either responded to the target in the cued hemifield or withheld response to all other stimuli. RT for each attention block is the mean reaction time to attended targets. For a missed target in the valid hemifield, the RT for that trial was set at 2 times the participant’s average RT during the entire experiment ( Wen et al., 2012a ). Both accuracy and RT were converted into z-sores. To be compatible with the convention used for accuracy, we multiplied the RT z-score by -1 so that for both accuracy and RT, higher z-scores mean better performance. For each subject, 12 attention blocks were ranked according to accuracy, and sorted into 10 groups in ascending order, each group consisting of 3 neighboring blocks. For RT, because the valid target was infrequent and trials were randomized, there were rare attention blocks where no valid target requiring a key response appeared. For each of the 10 subjects who had 11 block-wise RTs, the 11 blocks were ranked, sorted into 9 groups in ascending order, each consisting of 3 neighboring blocks. For the remaining two subjects who had 10 available block-wise RTs, there were also 9 sorted groups with the last group consisting of 2 neighboring blocks. 
 Granger causality and behavioral performance in each block were averaged across blocks within each group and then across subjects. The average Granger causality for each group was plotted as a function of the average behavioral performance for the same group. The relation in the scatter plot was assessed by both Spearman’s rank correlation and Pearson’s correlation. A correlation is considered significant if p<0.05 for both methods. Results are reported in terms of Spearman’s rank correlation. If the correlation between one causal influence and either accuracy or RT or both was significantly positive at p<0.05, then this influence is associated with better behavioral performance. In contrast, if the correlation was significantly negative at p<0.05, the influence is associated with worse behavioral performance. If a correlation was significantly positive for one behavioral measure but significantly negative for the other, the role of this connection is considered ambiguous. Ambiguous causal influences in this study were found to be very rare. 
 
 
 Linking causal influences with BOLD activity levels 
 For a given pair of ROIs, to examine how activity levels in each of the two areas are related to causal influences between them, the level of BOLD activity of each block was estimated, z-scored, sorted, grouped and correlated with Granger causality using the same procedure given above. The same was done at the network level for TCN and DMN. 
 
 
 Linking behavioral performance with BOLD activity levels 
 To examine how BOLD activity levels in a given ROI are related to behavioral performance, RT and accuracy of each block was z-scored, sorted, grouped and correlated with averaged BOLD activity level using the same procedure given above. 
 
 
 
 Results 
 Twelve subjects performed the attention task according to instructions. The overall mean reaction time was 426.80±47.45 ms and the mean accuracy was 82.13%±8.76%. 
 
 ROI selection 
 Attention blocks were contrasted against passive view blocks in  Figure 1B  to yield suprathreshold T-values (T>5.20, p<0.002, FDR corrected) which were color-coded and projected on a spatially normalized high-resolution MNI T1 template (Collins et al., 1998). As expected, dACC and bilateral AI of the task control network (TCN) were activated. For the same set of brain structures, other terms such as the core task-set system ( Dosenbach et al., 2006 ) and the salience network ( Menon and Uddin, 2010 ;  Menon, 2011 ) have also been used to refer to them. The three TCN ROIs were generated by intersecting each of the three activated TCN regions (T>5.20, p<0.002, FDR corrected) with a sphere of 5 mm in radius centered at the voxel with the maxima local T value (T>8.24, p<0.0002, FDR corrected). The coordinates of the three maximally activated voxels are given in  Table 1 . The number of voxels in the ROIs ranged from 17 (rAI) to 19 (dACC and lAI). Other activated regions included frontal eye fields and intraparietal sulcus of the dorsal attention network and right temporal parietal junction and right middle frontal gyrus of the ventral attention network. The interaction between these attention networks and its functional significance have been the subjects of a recent study ( Wen et al., 2012a ) and will not be pursued here. 
 Regions deactivated by the task were more diffuse. To more precisely identify the midline regions of DMN we applied group ICA to the resting-state data recorded in the same scanning session. The spatial ICA component (T>4.75, p<0.005, FDR corrected) containing the three midline regions of DMN, PCC, ventral MPFC (vMPFC) and dorsal MPFC (dMPFC), is shown in  Figure 1C . The center voxel coordinates for the three mDMN ROIs are given in  Table 1 . All the center voxels were contained in the task-deactivated regions (green regions in  Figure 1C  where T<−4.75, p<0.005, FDR corrected). The number of voxels in these mDMN ROIs ranged from 15 (vMPFC) to 19 (PCC and dMPFC). 
 
 
 Time course of BOLD response 
 The task response in a given ROI was calculated by averaging the percentage BOLD signal change first within the ROI and then across blocks and subjects ( Figure 1D ). Sustained BOLD elevation with attention is clearly seen in TCN ROIs, whereas sustained BOLD activity suppression of varying degrees with attention is clearly seen in DMN ROIs. The gray zone delineates the time period between the beginning and the end of a block. 
 
 
 Causal interactions between dACC and PCC 
 To illustrate the essential elements of our approach we start by considering two ROIs: dACC and PCC. For each subject, the accuracy and the mean reaction time of each attention block were converted into z-scores, and all attention blocks were sorted in an ascending fashion into accuracy and RT groups (see Methods). Granger causal influences dACC→PCC and PCC→dACC were calculated for each group and plotted as a function of the mean performance z-score of that group. As shown in  Figures 3A and 3B , dACC→PCC is positively correlated with both performance measures (R=0.87, p<0.005 for accuracy and R=0.77, p<0.05 for RT), meaning that the stronger the causal influence from dACC to PCC the better the behavioral performance (behavior-enhancing). (Note that for RT, a negative sign was applied when converting it to z-score so that the larger the z-score, the shorter the RT, and the better the performance.) In contrast, Granger causal influence in the opposite direction, PCC→dACC ( Figures 3C and 3D ), is negatively correlated with performance (R=−0.67, p<0.05 for accuracy and R=−0.95, p<0.0005 for RT), suggesting that the stronger the causal influence from PCC to dACC the worse the behavioral performance (behavior-degrading). 
 
 
 Causal interactions at the network level 
 Granger causal influences for all internetwork ROI pairs were calculated and averaged according to two categories, TCN→mDMN and mDMN→TCN. As shown in  Figures 3E-3H , stronger TCN→mDMN is associated with better behavioral performance (R=0.93, p<0.0005 for accuracy and R=0.63 p=0.076 for RT), whereas stronger causal influence in the opposite direction, mDMN→TCN, is associated with worse behavioral performance (R=−0.85, p<0.005 for accuracy and R=−0.92, p<0.005 for RT). These results extend the findings at the level of two ROIs (dACC and PCC) to the level of two networks (TCN and mDMN). 
 
 
 Contributions of individual ROIs 
 Results for all internetwork ROI pairs are shown in  Figures 3I and 3J . TCN ROIs are listed along the vertical axis and DMN ROIs the horizontal axis. Source ROIs are ROIs from which causal influences originate. Targets ROIs are ROIs toward which the causal influences flow. A cell in the matrix is colored red if the corresponding directional influence is positively correlated (p<0.05) with either RT or accuracy or both; in other words, red cells indicate behavior-enhancing influences. Similarly, a cell is colored blue if its corresponding directional influence is negatively correlated (p<0.05) with RT or accuracy or both; namely, blue cells indicate behavior-degrading influences. Otherwise, the cell is left transparent. Cells where accuracy (AC) and reaction time (RT) exhibited opposite correlations with causal influences are marked with colored letters. 
 From TCN to mDMN ( Figure 3I ), all five cells with significant Granger-behavior correlations are red, indicating behavior-enhancing influences. From mDMN to TCN, besides one cell whose function is ambiguous, the remaining cells with significant Granger-behavior correlations are blue, indicating behavior-degrading influences. The results in  Figures 3I and 3J  are further schematically illustrated in  Figure 3K , where red and blue arrows denote behavior-enhancing and behavior-degrading influences, respectively. 
 
 
 Causal influences and regional BOLD activity 
 How do causal influences impact BOLD activity in the target area? To investigate this question we correlated Granger causality with target area BOLD activity level. For dACC and PCC, the magnitude of PCC→dACC is negatively correlated with the BOLD level in dACC (R=−0.72, p<0.05), indicating that the stronger the causal influence from PCC to dACC, the less elevated the BOLD level in dACC ( Figure 4A ). In the opposite direction, dACC→PCC and the BOLD level of PCC also show a negative trend (R=−0.60, p=0.07), meaning that stronger dACC→PCC is associated with more depressed BOLD activity in PCC ( Figure 4B ). The same analysis was applied to all internetwork ROI pairs between TCN and mDMN. The result is displayed in a matrix form in  Figures 4C and 4D . In general, causal influences from mDMN ROIs ( Figure 4D ) are associated with less elevated BOLD activities in TCN ROIs (p<0.05 or p<0.1), whereas causal influences from TCN ROIs have a more complex relationship with mDMN BOLD activities (p<0.05 or p<0.1) ( Figure 4C ). 
 How do BOLD activities in the source area impact causal influences emanating from the area? To investigate this question we correlated Granger causality with the BOLD activity level in the source region and found that such correlations were rare at the ROI level. The only ROI exhibiting such correlation is rAI where its BOLD level is significantly negatively correlated with the magnitude of rAI→vMPFC (R=−0.96, p<0.0001). At the network level, however, we found that mean BOLD level in mDMN is significantly positively correlated with mDMN→TCN (R=0.68, p<0.05), indicating that less depressed activity in mDMN is associated with stronger mDMN→TCN, which is further associated with worse performance ( Figure 3G and 3H ). No correlation was found between TCN→mDMN and TCN BOLD level. 
 
 
 Regional BOLD activity and behavior 
 We correlated BOLD level in each ROI with accuracy and RT and found that the mean BOLD level in PCC is negatively correlated with accuracy (R=−0.68, p<0.05). A negative trend was seen between PCC BOLD level and RT (R=−0.65, p=0.067), This finding is consistent with previous reports that elevated PCC BOLD is associated with deteriorated task performance ( van Eimeren et al., 2009 ;  Santhanam et al., 2011 ;  Bonnelle et al., 2012 ). The BOLD level in lAI and vMPFC is negatively and positively correlated with accuracy respectively. At the network level, the BOLD level of TCN and mDMN showed no consistent correlation with behavioral performance. 
 
 
 
 Discussion 
 Recording fMRI from subjects performing a spatial visual attention task and combining Granger causality analysis with the naturally occurring variability in behavioral performance, the following results were found: (1) TCN→mDMN influences are positively correlated with behavioral performance (behavior-enhancing), (2) mDMN→TCN influences are negatively correlated with behavioral performance (behavior-degrading), (3) less depressed mDMN BOLD activity is associated with stronger mDMN→TCN influences and stronger mDMN→TCN influences are associated with less elevated BOLD activity in the TCN areas, and (4) the relation between TCN→mDMN influences and BOLD activity in mDMN areas is unsystematic. 
 
 ROI selection 
 As expected, TCN areas of dACC and bilateral AI were activated by the attention task. Past resting-state studies have found that these regions are correlated even when task demand is absent ( Menon and Uddin, 2010 ). Using a novel connectivity measure called total interdependence, we further demonstrated that dACC and AI form a distinct functional unit (dACC-AI network) at rest, whose spatial coordinates are highly compatible with the TCN ROIs selected in this study based on task activation ( Wen et al., 2012b ). For mDMN, we applied group ICA analysis to the resting-state data recorded in the same scanning session, and the ROIs of the mDMN so identified were found to be contained in the task deactivation map ( Greicius and Menon, 2004 ;  Buckner et al., 2008 ;  Lin et al., 2011 ). Time-course inspection revealed that attention-elevated BOLD activities in TCN ROIs and attention-suppressed BOLD activities in mDMN ROIs were both sustained over the entire trial block ( Figure 1D ). These highly replicable block-level BOLD responses are attributable to the mixed blocked and event-related design employed in this study ( Dosenbach et al., 2006 ). 
 
 
 TCN→DMN 
 TCN is thought to maintain task-level control across multiple trials by issuing signals to regulate other brain areas and configure the brain’s moment-to-moment information processing. In the theory’s current formulation, the areas that are thought to be influenced by these control signals are task-positive areas ( Dosenbach et al., 2008 ;  Wang et al., 2010 ;  Zanto et al., 2011 ). We extend the theory by showing that the TCN’s domain of influence also includes task-negative areas, specifically the areas of mDMN, and that the TCN’s top-down influences over these areas facilitate goal-oriented behavior ( Figure 3I ). Because mDMN is reliably associated with self-related processes, in tasks requiring externally oriented attention such as the one employed in this study, mDMN activity may be conceived of as a source of internal interference or noise ( Buckner et al., 2008 ;  Broyd et al., 2009 ;  Stawarczyk et al., 2011 ). This notion is supported by studies where insufficient deactivation of mDMN is found to be detrimental for behavioral performance in both normal populations and patients with brain disorders ( Lustig et al., 2003 ;  Mason et al., 2007 ;  Christoff et al., 2009 ;  Anticevic et al., 2010 ;  Spreng and Schacter, 2011 ). In this sense our finding that stronger TCN→mDMN is associated with enhanced behavioral performance suggests that TCN plays a role in the suppression of this internal noise. 
 
 
 DMN→TCN 
 Task-triggered interactions in large-scale cortical networks are likely to be bidirectional. No theory has appeared to date to account for how signals arising from mDMN may impact TCN. Our finding that higher mDMN BOLD level is associated with stronger mDMN→TCN and stronger mDMN→TCN is associated with less elevated BOLD level in TCN and degraded performance ( Figure 4D  and  Figure 3J ) further support the notion that mDMN activity represents a source of internal noise which adversely impacts behavior by sending signals to disrupt task set control functions carried out by TCN in demanding tasks. At the individual area level, mDMN→dACC is strictly behavior-degrading, in agreement with the idea that dACC maintains and enforces task rules ( Dosenbach et al., 2007 ;  Woodward et al., 2008 ;  Schulz et al., 2011 ) and as such is more vulnerable to interference from both internal and external sources of noise ( Buckner et al., 2008 ;  Corbetta et al., 2008 ). 
 
 
 Causal interactions and regional BOLD activities 
 At the ROI level, significant correlation mainly existed between causal influences and BOLD levels in the target areas. For example, increased dACC→PCC is associated with more depressed PCC BOLD level, whereas increased PCC→dACC is associated with less elevated dACC BOLD level. In conjunction with the finding that PCC BOLD level is negatively correlated with both RT and accuracy, these results may suggest that dACC suppresses internal noise by lowering PCC activity, and at the same time, PCC interferes with task control by lowering dACC activity. At the network level, mDMN→TCN are related to reduced activity levels in TCN, but in the opposite direction, no consistent patterns are seen ( Figure 4D and 4C ). The fact that less suppressed mDMN BOLD level is associated with stronger mDMN→TCN and stronger mDMN→TCN generally predicts less elevated TCN BOLD and worse performance suggests that phenomena typically attributed to mDMN, such as attentional lapses and mind wandering, may be partly achieved through its adverse impact on task control structures. On the other hand, the lack of a consistent pattern between TCN→mDMN and mDMN BOLD level may suggest that control signals from TCN to mDMN regulate different mDMN nodes using different mechanisms. 
 
 
 Methodology considerations 
 Temporal correlation and coherence are symmetric measures and do not yield directional information. But neural interactions are directional. In particular, when signals traveling in opposite directions are hypothesized to have different functional meanings, decomposition of neural interactions into their directional components becomes necessary. Commonly used methods such as structural equation modeling (SEM) ( McIntosh and Gonzalez-Lima, 1994 ) and dynamic causal modeling (DCM) ( Friston et al., 2003 ) depend on a preexisting theoretical framework. Granger causality, in contrast, is based on time series prediction, is more data-driven, and has proven to be a powerful tool for analyzing electrophysiological data ( Brovelli et al., 2004 ;  Bollimunta et al., 2008 ;  2011 ). Although the application of Granger causality to fMRI data is increasing ( Bressler et al., 2008 ;  Deshpande et al., 2008 ;  Rypma et al., 2006 ;  Duann et al., 2009 ;  Rypma and Prabhakaran, 2009 ;  Zhou et al., 2009 ;  Biswal et al., 2010 ;  Hwang et al., 2010 ;  Schippers et al., 2010 ;  Jiao et al., 2011 ;  Ge et al., 2012 ;  Stephan and Roebroeck, 2012 ;  Wen et al., 2012a ), concerns have been raised over the results’ neural interpretability ( Smith et al., 2011 ,  David et al., 2008 ). The main contention is whether fMRI-level Granger causality can recover neural-level network connectivity ( Roebroeck et al., 2005 ;  Deshpande et al., 2010 ,  Schippers et al., 2011 ). Over time scales resolvable by fMRI, interactions in large-scale cortical networks triggered by cognitive paradigms are likely to be bidirectional, and in cognitive neuroscience, it is often the changes of neuronal activity across experimental conditions that are important for inferring mechanisms. In this context, rather than asking whether there is a causal influence from A to B, a more pertinent question is: are changes in Granger causality at the fMRI level and that at the neuronal level related ( Roebroeck et al., 2005 ;  Biswal et al., 2010 ;  Wen et al., 2012a )? Using analytical methods and numerical simulations, we have found a monotonic relationship between the magnitude of GC at the fMRI-level and that at the neural-level ( Rangarajan et al., 2011 ), suggesting that increase or decrease of fMRI-level Granger causality as the experimental parameter is varied, can be interpreted in terms of the corresponding increase or decrease of neuronal-level Granger causality. The simulation, along with the extant neuroscience literature, provides the interpretational basis for this study where levels of behavioral performance are treated as such an experimental parameter. 
 Several additional remarks are in order. (1) At the individual subject level, the relation between brain and behavioral data is very noisy, making it hard to detect reliable correlations. Our method of averaging across blocks and subjects can effectively enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. We tested whether data from a few subjects can dominate the results by normalizing each subject’s data before averaging, and obtained almost identical results, precluding such a possibility. (2) Only pairwise Granger causality is considered in this study. This is reasonable given that our hypotheses did not specify the pathways along which the influences are transmitted. Conditional Granger causality is capable of yielding additional information on the relation between causal influences and anatomical connections ( Chen et al., 2006 ;  Ding et al., 2006 ). Because voxel-level BOLD signals were used, and the number of voxels across the 6 ROIs is large, a full conditional Granger causality analysis of the present data is not practical. (3) Significance test on individual Granger causality values was not performed. We relied instead on their collective relationship with other variables such as performance to assess their functional meaning. (4) Average BOLD responses in  Figure 1D  and residual BOLD fluctuations in  Figure 2D  may reflect different aspects of cognitive processing in much the same way as ERPs and ongoing oscillations reflect different aspects of cognitive processing in electrophysiology. In this study average BOLD responses were subtracted to obtain residual BOLD fluctuations for Granger causality analysis. Past electrophysiology work has shown that trial-to-trial variability of event-related responses may adversely impact Granger causality analysis of ongoing activity ( Wang et al., 2008 ). Although to what extent this issue may apply to fMRI data is not clear, the impact is likely to be small, the reason being that the residual BOLD time series are found to be stationary. (5) Slow TRs have always been a source of concern for time-series based connectivity analysis. The advent of faster sampling fMRI techniques ( Feinberg et al., 2010 ), however, is beginning to alleviate this concern. Faster TRs can help better preserve the relation between neural-level Granger causality and fMRI-level Granger causality ( Seth et al., 2013 ).

 Figure 1 
 
 Experimental paradigm and definition of ROIs. A: In each of 12 attention blocks (A blocks) the subject performed a trial-by-trial cued spatial attention task. At the beginning of each trial, the fixation cross was transiently replaced by a left-pointing or right-pointing arrow, which directed the subject to initiate and maintain covert attention to the cued hemifield. Following a delay, standard or target stimuli appeared in either the attended hemifield or unattended hemifield. The subject made a speedy key response to the small probability target stimuli in the attended hemifield when they appeared and withheld response to all other stimuli. In 12 passive view blocks (B blocks) stimuli were presented in the same way as in attention blocks but the subject was only required to fixate. F denotes a period of fixation. B: Group activation (n=12) by contrasting attention blocks against passive view blocks (T>5.20, p<0.002, FDR corrected). Regions of dACC and bilateral AI are selected as ROIs of TCN. C: Group deactivation (n=12) (T<−4.75, p<0.005, FDR corrected) is indicated in blue and group resting-state ICA map (n=12, T>4.75, p<0.005, FDR corrected) of DMN is indicated in purple. Midline regions of PCC, dMPFC, and vMPFC are selected as ROIs of DMN. D: Percentage BOLD signal change averaged within each ROI and then across blocks and subjects. Red color denotes the attention condition and blue color the passive view condition. The gray area outlines the block period. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 2 
 
 Data preprocessing and flowchart for Granger causality analysis. A: Schematic diagram of the preprocessing protocol. B: An example of the percentage BOLD signal change in the center voxel of dACC in one subject. C: Residual BOLD time series after average task response was removed in each block. D: Residual BOLD time series had their first 5 time-points discarded and temporal mean removed before being submitted to Granger causality analysis. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 3 
 
 Relation between Granger causal influences and behavioral performance. A-D: Granger causal influences as functions of accuracy score (AC) or reaction time score (RT) for the ROI pair PCC and dACC. The RT scores have been pre-multiplied by -1 so that larger RT scores denote shorter reaction time and hence better performance. Red color indicates positive correlation (behavior-enhancing) and blue color indicates negative correlation (behavior-degrading). Linear fits are shown with R being the Spearman correlation coefficient and p the significance level. E-H: Network-to-network causal influences as functions of AC or RT. Conventions are otherwise the same as in A-D. I-J: Matrix view of the relation between Granger causality and behavioral performance for all ROI pairs. A cell is colored red (blue) when Granger causal influence it represents is positively (negatively) correlated with either AC or RT or both at p<0.05 (see Methods). Otherwise, it is left transparent. If the causal influence is positively correlated with one performance measurement but negatively correlated with the other at (p<0.05), the cell is so indicated. K: A diagrammatic summary of the results in I and J. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 4 
 
 Relation between Granger causal influences and regional BOLD activities. A-B: Granger causal influences as functions of BOLD activity levels in target ROIs. C-D: Matrix view of the correlation between causal influences and BOLD activity levels. A cell is colored blue (red) if the corresponding influence is negatively (positively) correlated with the BOLD level in the target ROI. A deeper color denotes a significance level of p<0.05 and a shallower color denotes a significance level of p<0.1.
