 In an age-heterogeneous sample of healthy adults, we examined test-retest reliability (with and without participant re-positioning) of two popular MRI methods of estimating myelin content: modeling the short spin-spin (T2) relaxation component of multi-echo imaging data and computing the ratio of T 1 -weighted and T 2 -weighted images (T 1 w/T 2 w). Taking the myelin water fraction (MWF) index of myelin content derived from the multi-component T 2  relaxation data as a standard, we evaluate the concurrent and differential validity of T 1 w/T 2 w ratio images. The results revealed high reliability of MWF and T 1 w/T 2 w ratio. However, we found significant correlations of low to moderate magnitude between MWF and the T 1 w/T 2 w ratio in only two of six examined regions of the cerebral white matter. Notably, significant correlations of the same or greater magnitude were observed for T 1 w/T 2 w ratio and the intermediate T 2  relaxation time constant, which is believed to reflect differences in the mobility of water between the intracellular and extracellular compartments. We conclude that although both methods are highly reliable and thus well-suited for longitudinal studies, T 1 w/T 2 w ratio has low criterion validity and may be not an optimal index of subcortical myelin content.

 Introduction 
 Myelin, a core component of the central nervous system plays a critical role in ensuring speed and fidelity of neural transmission, efficiency of axonal energy metabolism, maintenance of membranes, formation of synapses and promotion of neuroplasticity (de Hoz and Simons, 2014;  Jebelli et al., 2015 ;  Saab et al., 2013 ). Myelination of axons is one of the pivotal phenomena of brain development (Ansari and Loch, 1976;  Barkovich et al., 1988 ;  Davison and Dobbing, 1966 ), whereas reduction of myelin content and alteration of its structure have been proposed as neuroanatomic substrates of age-related cognitive declines (Bartzokis, 2004;  Lu et al., 2013 ). Therefore, valid  in vivo  evaluation of regional myelin content, reflecting the myelination of axons, and reliable measurement of changes therein is a high priority. In recent years, several proxy indices of myelin content have been proposed of which two approaches have gained particular popularity: myelin water fraction (MWF) - derived from the modeling spin-spin (T2) relaxation components of multi-echo T 2  relaxation (ME-T 2 ) imaging data ( Mackay et al., 1994 ;  Whittal et al. 1997 ) - and the ratio of T 1 -weighted and T 2 -weighted MRI images (T 1 w/T 2 w,  Glasser and Van Essen, 2011 ). Both methods are non-invasive and hence suitable for  in vivo  longitudinal investigations, which are necessary for studying time-dependent processes such as development and aging ( Baltes and Nesselroade, 1979 ;  Kramer et al., 2000 ;  Lindenberger et al., 2011 ). 
 The first index, MWF, is based on modeling the multiple-echo water signal with multiple T2 relaxation times and determining the contribution of the short T 2  relaxation time constant or component, which is proportional to the amount of the water trapped between the myelin sheaths ( Curnes et al., 1988 ;  Menon et al. 1992 ). At present, it is considered a standard or reference method of myelin content estimation (Alonso-Ortiz et al., 2014;  Billiet et al., 2015 ), but its main disadvantages are the need for special MRI sequence and relatively long acquisition times. In addition to the short T 2  component associated with myelin water, a larger intracellular/extracellular water compartment with an intermediate T 2  relaxation time constant can also be quantified in the ME-T2 relaxation decay signal and its index, the geometric mean (geomT 2IEW ), is typically reported ( Mackay et al., 1994 ). Although the precise neurobiological significance of the geomT 2IEW  with respect to the intracellular/extracellular compartment is not fully understood, according to a combined ME-T 2  imaging and quantitative histology study, the geomT 2IEW  correlates positively with the diameter of axons in white matter tracts of the rat spinal cord. That is, enlargement of axonal diameter is accompanied by expansion of the intracellular space and increased mobility of the intracellular water, with ensuing increase in geomT 2IEW.  Thus ME-T 2  derived indices have the potential to describe various microstructural properties of white matter ( Dula et al., 2010 ). 
 The second putative myelin content index is based on standard T 1 - and T 2 -weighed sequences with relatively short acquisition times.  Glasser and Van Essen (2011)  argued that the pixel intensity on a T 1 –weighted image is directly proportional to the myelin contrast, χ, and inversely proportional to it on a T 2 -weighted image. They proposed that dividing the T 1 -weighted image by the T 2 -weighted image (and producing a T 1 w/T 2 w ratio) enhances the myelin contrast by χ 2  and can be used as a proxy for myelin content. However, the intensity non-uniformity (INU) on the images generated by the imperfection in the B 1  field differs between T 1 - and T 2 -weighted images, and thus does not adequately cancel when a ratio is taken ( Ganzetti et al. 2014 ). Recognition of that fact led to a revision of the method and adding independent INU correction for the T 1 - and T 2 -weighted images prior to computing the ratio ( Glasser and van Essen 2014 ;  Ganzetti et al. 2014 ). In addition, as a non-quantitative technique, T 1 w/T 2 w imaging is subjected to intensity scaling disparities across individuals and scanners. To overcome this,  Ganzetti and colleagues (2014)  have proposed a ‘calibration’ method that involves linearly transforming the INU-corrected images prior to computing the ratio. Although it is acknowledged that T 1 w/T 2 w image ratio is not an index of myelin, it is still considered a useful proxy for myelin content ( Schafee et al., 2015 ). Nonetheless, it remains unclear how close the two methods are in their evaluation of myelin content as there are no extant studies comparing the two approaches. Given the references status of MWF, the calibrated T 1 w/T 2 w image ratio method needs to be evaluated against it, thus testing the concurrent validity of the latter ( Cronbach and Meehl, 1955 ). 
 Because of the central role allotted to myelin in theories of aging and development (e.g., Bartzokis, 2004) and the importance of longitudinal studies in these areas of research, it is important to ensure suitability of putative indices of the brain myelin content and appraise their test-retest reliability. In particular, sensitivity to changes of participants’ position in the scanner that are inevitable in a study that involves multiple measurement occasions  needs to be examined . It is also important to determine whether the estimates of myelin content are equally reliable across multiple regions as differential reliability would present a threat to validity of inferences pertaining to heterochronicity of brain aging that has been postulated in the extant literature (see  Fjell et al., 2014 ;  Raz and Rodrigue, 2006  for reviews). To date, test-retest reliability of MWF has been assessed with high Pearson correlations between two scans reported ( Meyers et al., 2009 ), but unlike intraclass correlation (ICC), Pearson r is insensitive to linear changes in the index over occasions. In a subsequent study,  Meyers and colleagues (2013)  reported moderate test-retest reliability of MWF and high reliability of geomT 2IEW , as assessed by ICC. In two small sample studies of ME-T 2  repeatability, MWF was deemed to be less reliable than the geomT 2IEW  but no ICC values were reported ( Levesque et al., 2010 ;  Vavasour et al., 2006 ). A recent study of test-retest reliability of T 1 w/T 2 w measurements in a sample of 99 young adults observed a relatively modest Pearson r = .83 across all vertices of the map generated by FreeSurfer, with no ICC reported ( Schafee et al., 2015 ). 
 The main objectives of this study were, therefore, to evaluate the test-retest reliability of ME-T 2  and calibrated T 1 w/T 2 w indices in subcortical white matter tracts chosen as representatives of commissural, associative and projection fibers, and to establish concurrent validity of the latter index vis a vis the former. Based on previous work conducted on smaller samples, we hypothesized that MWF and geomT 2IEW  would meet the ICC ≥.80 criterion of reliability. By adding INU correction and ‘calibration’, we hypothesized that reliability of T 1 w/T 2 w ratios would also meet our reliability criterion. Finally, we tested myelin specificity of T 1 w/T 2 w ratio by comparing its correlations with MWF and geomT 2IEW , myelin-specific and intracellular/extracellular compartment indices derived from ME-T 2  relaxation imaging. 
 
 
 Methods 
 
 Participants 
 Twenty healthy adult participants were recruited from the Detroit metropolitan area. They were screened via a questionnaire for history of neurological and psychiatric disorders, cardiovascular disease other than medically treated hypertension, endocrine and metabolic disorders, head injury accompanied by loss of consciousness for more than five minutes, use of antiepileptic, anxiolytic, and antidepressant medications. The participants were equally divided by sex and had the mean age ± SD = 45.9 ± 17.1 years, range of 24.4 - 69.5 years, no difference between men and women:  t  (18) = −.81,  p  = .43. 
 
 
 Study Design 
 The MRI data were collected in a single session divided into two parts (see  Fig. 1  for illustration). The first part was devoted to acquiring a 3D volume of structural T 1 -weighted and T 2  -weighted MRI images and a ME-T 2  relaxation images followed by repeating only the acquisition of the ME-T 2  relaxation images, performed back-to-back, without re-positioning the participant in the MRI scanner. The participants were then removed from the scanner and given a five-minute break, following which they were re-positioned in the scanner for part 2 of the session that included a repeat of the T 1 -weighted, T 2 -weighted and ME-T 2  relaxation MRI sequences. All images were aligned at acquisition along the anterior-posterior commissure (AC-PC line). Study design is outlined in  Fig. 1 . 
 
 
 MRI acquisition protocol 
 The data were collected on a 3T Siemens MAGNETOM Verio TM  MRI system equipped with a 12-channel volume head coil. The T 1 -weighted images were acquired in the axial plane with isotropic voxels (1 mm 3 ) using the magnetization prepared gradient-echo (MPRAGE) sequence with a repetition time (TR) = 2400 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.63 ms, flip angle (FA) = 8º, inversion time (TI) = 1100 ms, matrix size = 256 × 256, number of slices = 160; GRAPPA factor = 2;  acquisition time (TA) = 8:07 min.  The T 2 -weighted sequence was also collected in the axial plane with isotropic voxel (1 mm 3 ) using the sampling perfection with application-optimized contrast with different flip-angle evolutions (SPACE) sequence with a TR = 3200 ms, TE = 449 ms, echo space = 3.52 ms, turbo factor = 141, matrix size = 250 × 250, number of slices = 176 and GRAPPA factor = 2;  TA=4:43 min.  ME-T 2  relaxation images were acquired in the axial plane using the 3D gradient and spin echo (GRASE) sequence, developed by Dr. Jongho Lee, Seoul National University, Republic of Korea). Acquisition parameters for the GRASE sequence were as follows: TR = 1100 ms, number of echoes = 32, first echo = 11 ms, inter-echo spacing = 11 ms, FOV = 190×220 mm 2 , matrix size = 165×192, slice thickness = 5 mm, number of slices = 24, slice oversampling = 0, in-plane resolution = 1.1 × 1.1 mm 2 ; TA=17 min. Parallel acquisition was not available for the GRASE sequence. 
 
 
 Processing of the ME-T 2  data 
 To generate ME-T 2  indices, MWF and the geomT 2IEW , for each region of interest (ROI) in the subjects space, we mapped ROIs from standard space (MNI152) to subject space followed by the voxel-wise ME-T 2  relaxation analysis for each ROI. ME-T 2  relaxation imaging data were analyzed using a combination of FMRIB Software Library (FSL), in-house Linux shell scripts and MATLAB (MATLAB 2013a, MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts) programs. Each dataset was interpolated to 2.5-mm thickness and co-registered to the structural T 1 -weighted volume from part 1 using the FSL FLIRT with 6 degrees of freedom ( Jenkinson and Smith, 2001 ;  Jenkinson et al., 2002 ). The procedure to generate the ROIs will be described in a separate section below and additional details are available in the previous publication ( Arshad et al., 2016 ). 
 Once the ROI masks were in the subject space, they were applied to the multi-echo data. Voxel-wise ME-T 2  relaxation analysis was conducted for each ROI using a regularized non-negative least squares (rNNLS) algorithm ( Whittall et al., 1997 ). The optimal value for the regularization parameter was determined via Generalized Cross Validation ( Golub et al., 1979 ). Non-ideal refocusing flip angles were accounted for in the fitting procedure using the extended phase graph (EPG) algorithm as part of the rNNLS fitting ( Hennig, 1988 ;  Prasloski et al., 2012 ). T 2  distributions were generated using 200 logarithmically spaced T 2  relaxation values ranging from 10 to 2000 ms. The MWF was calculated as the discrete integral of T 2  relaxation times between 10 and 40 ms and between 40 and 200 ms for the intracellular/extracellular water signal. MWF values were normalized to the discrete integral of T 2  relaxation times between 10 and 2000 ms, which reflected the total observed water signal. The geomT 2 iew  was calculated on the logarithmic scale ( Whittal et al., 2002 ). 
 
 
 Processing of the calibrated T 1 w/T 2 w ratio imaging data 
 Similar to the ME-T 2  analysis, the calibrated T 1 w/T 2 w ratio values were generated in the subjects’ space for each ROI. Because the INU differs for T 1 - and T 2 -weighted images, we corrected both images independently and used the ‘calibration’ method proposed by Ganzetti et al. to account for intensity scaling differences across both subjects and within subject (due to repositioning). The T 1 - and T 2  -weighted images were first skull-stripped using the FSL BET tool ( Smith, 2002 ), with a value of .3 for the fractional intensity threshold, and binary brain masks were saved. Skull-stripped images were co-registered to the T 1 -weighted image from part 1 using FLIRT 6 degrees of freedom and the transformation matrices were saved. Co-registration between T 1 - and T 2  -weighted images were conducted using mutual information cost function in FLIRT. The saved transformation matrices, which were previously generated, were applied to the brain masks and to the non-deskulled images. After application of the transformation matrix to the brain masks, they were binarized. Each non-deskulled image was corrected for INU using the nonuniform intensity normalization (N3) algorithm ( Sled and Zijdenbos, 1998 ). Brain masks were provided to the N3 along with the non-deskulled images. Although the N3 method is widely used for INU correction ( Zheng et al., 2009 ), its default parameters are optimized for the 1.5 T field strength. Previous studies have shown that setting of the parameter controlling the smoothness of the bias field at the default value of 200 mm is not optimal for 3T scanners ( Zheng et al., 2009 ). We used a value of 100 mm for the smoothness of the bias field because the wavelength would be expected to decrease by a factor of 2 when going from 1.5 to 3T field strength. 
 Following INU correction we ‘calibrated’ the images using the linear transformation method proposed by  Ganzetti and colleagues (2014) . The ‘calibration’ requires intensity values from the eye and temporalis muscle from both the T 1 - and T 2 -weighted images. These regions were defined in the MNI152 space and mapped to the subjects’ space. The procedure to map the eye and temporalis muscle from the template to subject space is described below. The masks were then applied to the T 1 - and T 2 -weighted images. Histograms for each mask were generated and intensity values below the 10 th  and greater than the 90 th  percentile were removed, followed by calculating the median intensity value. These values serve as the person-specific values for the eye and temporalis muscle for the T 1 - and T 2 -weighted images. Similar to  Ganzetti et al. (2014) , we used the following reference values for the eye mask: 28.2 arbitrary units for T 1 -weighted image and 99.9for the T 2 -weighted image. For the temporalis muscle mask the reference values were: 58.6 for the T 1 -weighted image and 21.1 for the T 2 -weighted image. Ratio images were calculated after calibration. 
 
 
 Regional Parcellation and Post-processing 
 Regions of interest (ROIs), , were defined  in FSL (Jenkinson et al., 2012)  using the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and ICBM-DTI-81 white matter atlas ( Hua et al., 2008 ;  Wakana et al., 2007 ), in template space, and included two midline commissural tracts: genu (genu CC) and splenium (splenium CC) of the corpus callosum; two right and left association tracts: superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF); and two right and left projection tracts: anterior (ALIC) and the posterior (PLIC) limbs of the internal capsule. The overarching goal was to convert these ROIs from the template space into the subjects’ space and then apply these masks to the ME-T2 and T 1 w/T 2 w images. Because we compare ME-T 2  indices to the calibrated T 1 w/T 2 w ratio, we wanted to ensure that the ROIs used for both analyses were identical. 
 To generate the warp field for mapping from the template to the subjects’ space, we used the FSL non-linear registration tool FNIRT to register the T 1 -weighted image from part 1 to the MNI152 template. The resultant warp field was saved, inverted and used to map all ROIs, including the eye and temporalis muscle masks, from template to subject space. To reduce partial voluming artifacts we first segmented the T 1 -weighted image into white matter, gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid using the FSL tool FAST ( Zhang et al. 2001 ). We then applied the masks to the segmented white matter and set a threshold of .95 followed by binarizing the masks. This ensured that our ROI masks consisted of white matter with a probability of .95 or greater. These masks were applied to INU corrected and ‘calibrated’ T 1 w/T 2 w images to yield T 1 w/T 2 w ratios for each ROI. 
 For the ME-T 2  analysis, these masks were downsampled to 2.5 mm thickness and applied to ME-T 2  data. The MWF and geomT 2 iew  were averaged within an ROI. To minimize rounding errors, MWF values were multiplied by 100, resulting in units of percentage for MWF. The geomT 2 iew  values were multiplied by 1000, giving units of milliseconds (ms). The T 1 w/T 2 w ratios were multiplied by 100 and are unit-less. Bilateral ROI values were averaged, yielding single measures, and thus reducing the number of comparisons. All ROIs in the ME-T 2  and T 1 w/T 2 w datasets were inspected for gross registration errors. 
 
 
 Statistical analyses 
 Reliability was quantified by the intraclass correlation coefficient, namely the formula assuming random effects, ICC(1,1) ( Shrout and Fleiss, 1979 ). According to  Shrout and Fleiss (1979) , there are three cases of intraclass correlations applicable to assessment of reliability. Case 3 that assumes that each method or rater or, in our study, scanning run are fixed, and the results can be generalized only if the identical runs are repeated. This assumption is unrealistic and precludes generalizing to other runs on other MRI scanners and on other days. Case 1 assumes that each run is different, and is drawn from a set of all possible runs at random. A run being application, in a randomly determined scheduling time, of a certain scanner configuration and scanner hardware state to produce imaging data is presumed randomly selected from a set of MRI scanners and their hardware/software configurations available for imaging. Hence, our selection of ICC(1,1) formula for comparing back-to-back runs for the ME-T 2  data. For assessing the effect of participant repositioning in the scanner, we compared Run 2 and Run 3 for the ME-T 2  data and Run 1 and Run 2 for the T 1 w/T 2 w data (across part 1 and 2 for both datasets). In this comparison, participant’s deviation on Run 3 from their position in the scanner on Run 2 was assumed random and ICC(1,1) was selected again. 
 Bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals, using 5000 samples, were generated for the analysis on the ME-T 2  indices and T 1 w/T 2 w data. ICC values ≥ .80 were considered reliable. These analyses were conducted by combining all ROIs and for each ROI independently. ICC values along with 95% confidence intervals are reported for all ROIs combined as well as individual ROIs. Finally, the association between the T 1 w/T 2 w ratio and the ME-T 2  indices (MWF and geomT 2 iew ) were evaluated using linear regression. ROIs from the T 1 w/T 2 w data were averaged across part 1 and 2 while the ME-T 2  ROIs were averaged across Runs 2 and 3. These runs were chosen, for the ME-T 2  data, because they were collected with re-positioning of the participant in between, similar to the T 1 w/T 2 w data. The averaged values were used in the linear regression. All statistical analyses were conducted using MATLAB version 2012a (MATLAB 2012a, MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts). 
 
 
 
 Results 
 
 Reliability of indices derived from the ME-T 2  relaxation imaging 
 For both indices, the individual regions’ ICC values exceeded the set threshold of reliability, except for the SLF whose MWF ICC value was .79 after re-positioning. However, dropping one observation with an extreme MWF value increased the ICC to .84. Moreover,  the overlapping  95% confidence intervals, suggest uniform reliability across the sampled regions, see  Table 1 . With all ROIs aggregated into a single global region, both MWF and geomT 2 iew  yielded ICC values > .80 for the back-to-back run and after re-positioning. 
 
 
 Reliability of calibrated T 1 w/T 2 w ratio imaging 
 Two participants had wrap-around artifacts on their T 2 -weighted images, and one participant had motion artifacts on the T 1 -weighted images. These participants were excluded from T 1 w/T 2 w analyses,  which were thus conducted on N=17 . When all ROIs were combined, the T 1 w/T 2 w ratio met our reliability criterion. However, the regional analysis revealed that for PLIC, reliability fell somewhat short of the set level of .80 (see  Table 1 ). 
 
 
 Associations between ME-T 2  indices and T 1 w/T 2 w ratio 
 The bivariate distributions of ME-T 2  indices and T 1 w/T 2 w ratio, and regression lines for aggregated and separate ROIs as well as bivariate correlations between each pair of indices are presented in  Fig. 2 . 
 
 MWF vs T 1 w/T 2 w ratio 
 The correlations between regional MWF and T 1 w/T 2 w ratios were  positive  and ranged between . 21  and . 65 (median r=.44) , with  only the  ALIC reaching the adjusted significance level, and the Genu reaching the unadjusted significance level. However, when all ROIs are combined, the correlation between MWF and T 1 w/T 2 w ratio was  negative: r  = −. 26 , p<.05. Significance of the sign reversal in the correlation between two putative indices of myelin is discussed below. 
 
 
 T 1 w/T 2 w ratio vs geomT 2 iew 
 The correlations between geomT 2 iew  and calibrated T 1 w/T 2 w ranged between −.11 and −.69 ( median r=−.66,  see  Fig. 2 ). Regional correlations were significant at the adjusted level of significance for the Genu and Splenium, SLF and IFOF. Similar to the regional correlations, when all ROIs were combined we found a  statistically  significant correlation, with the negative sign retained ( r  = −.54, p<.05). 
 
 
 MWF and geomT 2 iew 
 The correlations between MWF and geomT 2 iew  ranged between −. 50  and . 21 (median r=−.16) , with all but one being negative (see  Fig. 2 ). Regional correlations were significant at the unadjusted level of significance only for the SLF. As in the case of associations between MWF and T 1 w/T 2 w, for aggregated ROIs we found a statically significant correlation, with the sign reversed to positive:  r  =. 43 , p<.05). 
 
 
 
 
 Discussion 
 
 ME-T 2  derived indices of myelin content and intracellular/extracellular water are reliable 
 The indices of myelin content (MWF), and intracellular/extracellular water compartment (geomT 2 iew)  derived from ME-T 2  imaging showed adequate reliability and stability making them suitable for longitudinal studies. Of note, MWF and geomT 2 iew  were equally reliable across the ROIs investigated. This uniformity  mitigates  concerns about differential unreliability that could threaten the validity of conclusions based on differences among associations between regional myelin content and variables of interest such as age. Given the wide confidence intervals this conclusion must be qualified by a caveat that in a larger sample size small differences in reliability across the tracts could be detected. Nonetheless, our study confirms high reliability of ME-T 2  indices (and greater reliability of geomT 2IEW  compared to MWF) in a much larger sample and wider age range than previously reported ( Levesque et al., 2010 ;  Meyer et al., 2009 ,  2013 ;  Vavasour et al., 2006 ). 
 
 
 Reliability of calibrated T 1 w/T 2 w imaging 
 We found that across the white matter tracts investigated here, calibrated T 1 w/T 2 w ratio had high test-retest reliability. Although for one region (PLIC) the ICC did not meet the set reliability criterion of .80, the overlapping 95% confidence intervals suggest that we do not have differential reliability across ROIs. Therefore, calibrated T 1 w/T 2 w ratio is of sufficient reliability in white matter tracts to make it useful in longitudinal studies. 
 
 
 Validity of calibrated T 1 w/T 2 w ratio as a proxy for myelin content 
 Reliability is the upper limit of validity and having reliable measures constitutes a necessary but not a sufficient condition for producing valid estimates of myelin content. With reliability of the examined indices of myelin established, we now address the issue of validity. Although T 1 w/T 2 w imaging has multiple advantages - high spatial resolution (1 mm 3 ), reasonably straightforward processing of the images for calibration and no need for custom MRI acquisition sequences, it is unclear whether it yields a valid proxy for myelination, i.e., has good concurrent validity. Although ME-T 2 -based calculation of MWF is hampered by a smaller signal (and hence lower spatial resolution) relative to T 1 w/T 2 w, and requires special acquisition sequences followed by more complex modeling, it has been histologically validated as an index of myelin content in cortical and subcortical white matter tracts ( Laule et al., 2006 ;  McCreary et al., 2009 ;  Webb et al., 2003 ). Finding low to moderate correlations between MWF and T 1 w/T 2 w with none of them accounting for even 50% of the inter-method variance suggests that at least within the examined regions, the validity of T 1 w/T 2 w is unsatisfactory. In other words, at least in subcortical white matter tracts, the T 1 w/T 2 w ratio is a poor proxy for myelination in spite of its high reliability. 
 Moreover, T 1 w/T 2 w showed closer association with the other index derived from ME-T 2  imaging, geomT 2IEW , which is not expected to be directly related to myelin content. In four of the examined six ROIs, T 1 w/T 2 w was associated with the geomT 2 iew  rather than with MWF, a measure of myelin content. Given the established high reliability of each index, low correlations of T 1 w/T 2 w with MWF combined with its higher correlations with an index that does not represent myelin content suggest that T 1 w/T 2 w measures something else rather than myelin content. What are the properties of the white matter that are tapped by T 1 w/T 2 w remains to be discovered. We can only offer a speculative account of its possible substrates. 
 The short T 2  relaxation component (~10-40 ms at 3T) that is used to compute MWF reflects highly restricted mobility of water molecules trapped between the myelin sheaths. The number of myelin lamina (and thus myelin thickness) is related to axonal diameter in an almost linear fashion ( Walhovd et al., 2014 ), and with increasing number of myelin wraps around axons, MWF also rises. The water signal associated with the intermediate T 2  relaxation component, geomT 2 iew,  corresponds to less restricted water molecules in the intracellular and extracellular space and thus is not a faithful representative of myelin content. However, two factors should be considered in discussing the neurobiological meaning of the geomT 2 iew  value: axon size and axon packing density. 
 As the axon caliber increases proportionately to thickness of its myelin sheath, the intracellular space expands and subsequent increase in the geomT 2IEW  ensues. Therefore, white matter tracts that contain axons of larger caliber are expected to yield longer geomT 2IEW  values. Indeed, PLIC, a region that contains some of the largest axons originating from and projecting to somatosensory and motor regions ( Tomasi et al., 2012 ) evidenced (along with splenium) the longest geomT 2IEW  in our sample. In rat spinal cord, larger axonal diameter was associated with longer geomT 2 iew  values ( Dula et al., 2010 ). Thus, in a given region, geomT 2IEW  is positively correlated with axonal caliber. 
 The signal from subcortical white matter tracts is composed of contributions from water trapped between the myelin sheaths and water located in the intracellular and extracellular space. Although the multi-T 2  relaxation components differentiate between these distinct water environments, the measured signal from T 1 - and T 2  -weighted images does not allow such inter-compartmental resolution. Therefore, while myelin may influence the T 1 w/T 2 w ratio to some extent, the magnitude of this association is rather modest and inconsistent across the white matter tracts. Given that the typical TE time for a T 2 w sequence used in T 1 w/T 2 w ratio imaging is relatively long, the signal contrast from the T 2 -weighted images cannot be influenced by the short T 2  relaxation component attributable to the water between the myelin sheaths. Therefore, this suggests that the IE compartment is the primary source of the observed signal on the T 2 -weighted image. This is consistent with the observed relatively higher correlation of T 1 w/T 2 w ratios with the geomT 2 iew  rather than with MWF. 
 Correlations between T 1 w/T 2 w ratio with geomT 2IEW  in four out of six examined regions, including two of the commissural tracts, genu and splenium may reflect neurobiological structural differences among these regions. Along corpus callosum, from genu to splenium, axon packing density gradually declines and axon caliber increases ( Aboitz et al. 1992 ;  LaMantia and Rakic, 1990 ;  Riise and Pakkenberg, 2011 ;  De Santis et al., 2016 ). As splenium has more myelin compared to genu, if T 1 w/T 2 w ratio were indeed a proxy for myelin, it would be expected to be greater in the former compared to the latter. Contrary to that expectation, we find a smaller T 1 w/T 2 w ratio in the splenium – a result that is expected if the axon density/diameter rather than myelin is the dominant influence on that index. Similar results were found in a post-mortem study that measured myelin content and the T 1 w/T 2 w ratio along the corpus callosum ( Sandrone et al., 2015 ). Thus, T 1 w/T 2 w ratio may reflect variation in caliber and packing density of the axons more than myelin content. This conclusion is in line with a recent observation of larger-caliber axons having longer T1 thus suggesting that the T1w/T2w ratio may be sensitive to variations in axonal diameter (Harkins et al. 2016). 
 In examining the bivariate associations between the white matter measures, we noted a curious reversal of sign in associations of MWF with T1w/T2w ratio and geomT2iew that occurred when the data were analyzed by individual ROIs vs their sum. Such discrepancy between the associations observed in aggregated data versus findings for specific subgroups or regions is known as Simpson paradox, which strictly speaking is not a paradox at all but a reflection of regional data structure that is obscured by aggregation ( Simpson, 1951 ;  Kievit et al., 2013 ). Nevertheless, in the case of associations between the two indices of myelin content, the observed pattern may reflect neurobiological reality and reinforce the conjecture that T 1 w/T 2 w ratio reflects mainly axonal caliber and packing density rather than myelin content. 
 When the analysis is restricted to a specific homogeneous region, the variation in the axonal diameters between subjects maybe smaller than the differences in myelin content and therefore the T 1 w/T 2 w ratio is influenced by myelin to a greater extent, hence a positive (though still small) correlation. However, when all ROIs are combined, the variation in the axonal diameters across the tracts increases. Regions containing axons of larger caliber have a longer geomT 2IEW , (and a smaller T 1 w/T 2 w ratio), and this effect seems to overpower the effect of myelin content on the T 1 w/T 2 w ratio, hence resulting in a negative correlation. In sum, strong circumstantial evidence indicates that the T 1 w/T 2 w ratio is influenced by axonal diameter and packing density. Because the goal of this paper was not to investigate the relationship between the axonal diameter and the T 1 w/T 2 w ratio, we do not have independent measures of that property. Nonetheless, these promising results suggest that future investigations should combine more advanced diffusion imaging techniques, capable of estimating axonal diameter, with the T 1 w/T 2 w imaging to directly test this hypothesis. 
 The findings described here may have a significant impact on understanding of white matter properties under pinning cognitive performance and individual differences therein. Myelin loss has been hypothesized as a potential substrate of reduced processing speed in both normal aging and in neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Reliable assessment of individual differences in myelin content and changes over time via MWF will allow a more focused evaluation of the myelination-speed of processing relationship than previously reported. If both the geomT 2IEW  and the T 1 w/T 2 w ratio are indeed more sensitive to axonal diameter and axonal density than they are to myelin content, their role in processing speed and other cognitive functions can be evaluated and dissociated from that of myelin. There potential applications should provide impetus to further exploration of diverse aspects of white matter structure via assessment of distinct components of the T 2  relaxation. 
 
 
 Limitations 
 First, because of time constraints, we could not add another run before repositioning and compare run 3 and run 4 (repositioned participant) instead of comparing Run 2 and Run 3 (re-positioned participant). Run 2 being already a part of the back-to-back runs comparison introduces dependence in estimation of repositioning effects. 
 Second , although we show the discrepancies between MWF and the T 1 w/T 2 w ratio in evaluating subcortical white matter, we did not investigate this relationship in the cortex. The myelin content in cortical gray matter is too low for reliable detection by current in-vivo ME-T 2  imaging. A recent publication observed the “inverted U” relationship between age and the T 1 w/T 2 w ratio in the cortex ( Grydeland al., 2013 ), in accord with post mortem literature ( Kaes, 1907 ) and may be in line with the hypothesized role of the T 1 w/T 2 w ratio as myelin content index. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate the relationship between the T 1 w/T 2 w ratio and cortical myelin content with histological methods and improved ME-T 2  imaging. 
 Third , potential effects of iron on the estimates of myelin content may be considered. Such influence, however, is highly unlikely, for even though oligodendrocytes are indeed significant repositories of iron ( Connor and Benkovic.,1992 ), the refocusing pulses of the ME-T 2  acquisition are insensitive to any parametric effects of ferric iron ( Chavhan et al. 2009 ). Therefore, unlike gradient-echo acquisition schemes ( Oh et al., 2013 ), the modeling of the multiple T 2  relaxation components of ME-T 2  data is not affected by iron composition, as confirmed by  ex vivo  studies ( Li et al., 2009 ). Nonetheless, new T2*-based methods may offer improvements in MWF mapping while overcoming the abovementioned limitations ( Lee et al., 2016 ). 
 
 
 
 Conclusions 
 Both MWF and geomT 2 iew  indices produce very reliable measurements over multiple white matter areas. Thus, ME-T 2  imaging is suitable for  in vivo  longitudinal investigations of myelin content. In contrast, while also showing high and regionally uniform reliability, the T 1 w/T 2 w ratio revealed limited validity as an index of myelin content. It does not appear a sufficiently specific index of subcortical myelin content as it appears to correlate more with the intermediate T 2  relaxation component that reflects axonal caliber and density than with the short T 2  relaxation component that represents water trapped in myelin.
