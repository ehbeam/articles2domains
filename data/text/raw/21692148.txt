 Previous neuroimaging studies have shown that working memory load has marked effects on regional neural activation. However, the mechanism through which working memory load modulates brain connectivity is still unclear. In this study, this issue was addressed using dynamic causal modeling (DCM) based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Eighteen normal healthy subjects were scanned while they performed a working memory task with variable memory load, as parameterized by two levels of memory delay and three levels of digit load (number of digits presented in each visual stimulus). Eight regions of interest, i.e., bilateral middle frontal gyrus (MFG), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), inferior frontal cortex (IFC), and posterior parietal cortex (PPC), were chosen for DCM analyses. Analysis of the behavioral data during the fMRI scan revealed that accuracy decreased as digit load increased. Bayesian inference on model structure indicated that a bilinear DCM in which memory delay was the driving input to bilateral PPC and in which digit load modulated several parieto-frontal connections was the optimal model. Analysis of model parameters showed that higher digit load enhanced connection from L PPC to L IFC, and lower digit load inhibited connection from R PPC to L ACC. These findings suggest that working memory load modulates brain connectivity in a parieto-frontal network, and may reflect altered neuronal processes, e.g., information processing or error monitoring, with the change in working memory load.

 INTRODUCTION 
 Working memory refers to a short-term memory system that provides temporary storage of the information necessary for complex cognitive tasks such as language comprehension, learning, and reasoning ( Baddeley, 1992 ). Since the proposal of the tripartite working memory model by  Baddeley and Hitch (1974) , there have been numerous studies on working memory involving several different fields, e.g., animal ( Constantinidis and Procyk, 2004 ;  Fuster, 1994 ;  Goldman-Rakic, 1990 ), lesion ( D’Esposito et al., 2006 ;  Muller and Knight, 2006 ), behavioral ( Cowan, 2001 ;  Engle, 2010 ), and neuroimaging ( D’Esposito et al., 2006 ;  Owen et al., 2005 ;  Schlosser et al., 2006 ;  Smith and Jonides, 1998 ;  Wager and Smith, 2003 ). Working memory may be part of long-term memory ( Cowan, 1995 ;  Cowan, 2005 ), and its capacity is generally considered to be limited ( Cowan, 2001 ; Cowan et al., 2005). A meta-analysis of normative functional neuroimaging studies showed that lateral premotor cortex, dorsal cingulate and medial premotor cortex, dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, frontal poles, and medial and lateral posterior parietal cortex robustly activated when participants conducted n-back working memory tasks ( Owen et al., 2005 ). 
 An important research topic on working memory is how working memory load affects brain function. Using an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) design,  Rypma and D’Esposito (1999)  investigated the effects of verbal working memory load and found increased activation in dorsal prefrontal cortex when the load increased from low to high ( Rypma and D’Esposito 1999 ). In another fMRI study,  Rypma et al. (1999)  used a Sternberg task and found effects of increased working memory load in left caudal inferior frontal gyrus when the load increased from one to three letters. Additional activation (notably middle and superior frontal gyri) was observed when memory load further increased from three to six letters ( Rypma et al., 1999 ). Using fMRI and two different working memory tasks (Sternberg and n-back tasks),  Veltman et al. (2003)  observed increased signal in bilateral dorsolateral and anterior prefrontal, left ventrolateral prefrontal, and bilateral parietal regions that correlated with load common for both tasks.  Tomasi et al. (2007)  used fMRI to assess the effects of verbal working memory load and visual attention load, and found that increased cognitive load activated a common network comprising parietal and occipital cortices, thalamus, and the cerebellum. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and a Sternberg task,  Jensen and Tesche (2002)  found that the activity in the theta band oscillations (7-8.5 Hz) (as reflected by theta power) generated in frontal brain regions increased parametrically with memory load during memory maintenance. These neuroimaging regional activation studies suggest that working memory load may have effects on a broad network, including frontal, posterior association, subcortical regions, and cerebellum. 
 Accumulated findings from human and animal studies have led to models for interpreting the neural basis of working memory as interactions between functionally related brain regions (interregional connectivity) ( Carpenter et al., 2000 ;  D’Esposito 2007 ;  Funahashi 2006 ;  Fuster 2009 ). A recent model has proposed that working memory is represented in the brain by networks of neurons consisting of interactive frontal and posterior association regions ( Fuster 2006 ;  Fuster 2008 ;  Fuster 2009 ). Interregional connectivity based on functional imaging data is generally quantified by using functional connectivity or effective connectivity analysis techniques ( Friston 1995a ). Functional connectivity has been defined as the correlations between spatially remote neurophysiological events ( Friston 1995a ), and effective connectivity refers to the influence one neural system exerts over another by quantifying the causal effect that one region’s activity has on that of another region ( Friston 1995a ). 
 Working memory has been investigated using functional connectivity ( Abe et al., 2007 ;  Edin et al., 2009 ;  Edin et al., 2007 ;  Fiebach et al., 2006 ;  Gazzaley et al., 2007 ;  Gazzaley et al., 2004 ;  Grady et al., 2001 ;  Hampson et al., 2010 ;  Lenartowicz and McIntosh 2005 ;  Mayer et al., 2010 ) or effective connectivity ( Au Duong et al., 2005 ;  Chang et al., 2007 ;  Cook et al., 2007 ;  Koechlin et al., 2003 ;  Kondo et al., 2004a ;  Petersson et al., 2006 ;  Rosenbaum et al., 2010 ;  Schlosser et al., 2003 ;  Schlosser et al., 2006  (review);  Szatkowska et al., 2008 ), but none of these studies focused on the modulation effects of working memory load. A relatively small number of published functional connectivity studies (e.g.,  Palva et al., 2010 ;  Payne and Kounios, 2009 ;  Rissman et al., 2008 ;  Woodward et al., 2006 ) and one published effective connectivity study ( Honey et al., 2002 ) have systematically investigated the effects of working memory load. Using a constrained principal component analysis and a variable load version of the Sternberg task,  Woodward et al. (2006)  identified a load-dependent functional connectivity network for encoding, comprising bilateral occipital, bilateral superior parietal, bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal, and dorsal anterior cingulate regions.  Woodward et al. (2006)  also identified a load-enhanced functional connectivity network for maintenance, including left posterior parietal, left inferior prefrontal, left premotor and supplementary motor areas, and dorsal cingulate regions; and identified a load-suppressed functional connectivity network for maintenance, including bilateral occipital, posterior cingulate, and rostral anterior cingulate/orbitofrontal regions ( Woodward et al., 2006 ). Using event-related fMRI,  Rissman et al. (2008)  assessed the effects of visual working memory load on the functional connectivity between the prefrontal cortex and posterior visual association areas. Their results showed that during the delay period the connectivity between right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the fusiform face area (FFA) decreased, and that the connectivity between hippocampus and FFA and between hippocampus and IFG increased as the memory load increased. In addition, there was a significant negative association between the functional connectivity between the FFA and the hippocampus and the functional connectivity between the FFA and the IFG. Based on these findings, the authors concluded that the IFG-FFA interactions mediate working memory maintenance at lower loads, and that hippocampal interactions mediate working memory maintenance at higher loads ( Rissman et al., 2008 ). Using electroencephalography (EEG) and a modified Sternberg task,  Payne and Kounios (2009)  found that theta-band (4-8 Hz) coherence between frontal-midline and left temporal-parietal sites and alpha-band (8-13 Hz) coherence between midline parietal and left temporal/parietal sites increased with memory load. In a combined MEG and EEG study,  Palva et al. (2010)  found that, during the visual working memory retention period, the interareal phase synchrony among frontoparietal regions in alpha- (10-13 Hz), beta- (18-24 Hz), and gamma- (30-40 Hz) frequency bands was strengthened with increasing memory load. Using structural equation modeling (SEM) on fMRI data and an n-back verbal working memory task with variable load,  Honey et al. (2002)  found that increased memory load enhanced inferior fronto-parietal and prefronto-prefrontal effective connectivity; however the modulation effect of load was determined only indirectly due to inherent limitations of the SEM methodology. Thus, the previous studies on connectivity and working memory load share the common result of finding memory-load enhanced networks. However, there have been several differences in terms of which regions were involved, and the one previous study that investigated effective connectivity examined modulation effects only indirectly ( Honey et al., 2002 ). Thus, the role of working memory load in modulating effective connectivity in humans has not been conclusively established. 
 In this study, we used dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to investigate the effects of working memory load on effective connectivity in the working memory network. The present study is different from a previous effective connectivity study ( Honey et al., 2002 ) in at least two aspects. First, we used DCM, which is a novel technique specially developed for evaluating neuroimaging-based effective connectivity ( Daunizeau et al., In Press ;  Friston et al., 2003 ;  Stephan et al., 2007a ), rather than SEM used by  Honey et al. (2002) . Compared to SEM ( Buchel and Friston 1997 ;  Honey et al., 2002 ;  Ma et al., 2010 ;  McIntosh and Gonzalez-Lima 1994 ) or other methods like Granger causality analysis ( Goebel et al., 2003 ;  Roebroeck et al., 2005 ), one can use DCM to explicitly (or directly) evaluate the modulation effects of contextual conditions on effective connectivity ( Friston et al., 2003 ;  Stephan et al., 2007a ). In addition, effective connectivity in DCM is modeled at the underlying neuronal level rather than the observed hemodynamic level ( Friston et al., 2003 ;  Stephan et al., 2007a ). It has been shown by  David et al. (2008)  that DCM may have advantages over connectivity analysis methods that work on the observed hemodynamic level because different brain regions may have different hemodynamic response functions, resulting in irrelevant temporal precedence between brain regions. Secondly, we used immediate memory task (IMT) and delayed memory task (DMT) protocol ( Dougherty et al., 2002 ;  Dougherty et al., 1998 ;  Moeller et al., 2004 ;  Moeller et al., 2010 ) in which memory load is parameterized by both memory delay duration and number of digits per stimulus (digit load) rather than an n-back working memory protocol in which memory load is only parameterized by delay duration. 
 
 
 MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
 Subjects 
 This study was approved by the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects (the institutional review board, IRB) at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, and was performed in accordance with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki). Normal healthy subjects were recruited through advertisements for research volunteers. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects by the investigators or the research staff. 
 After meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria (please see the  Supplementary Materials  for criteria and details of screening), a total of 18 (9 males, 9 females) healthy subjects were included in this study out of the 32 subjects who were initially screened. The 18 subjects who were included had a mean age of 34.7 years (± 9.8 years, standard derivation), ranging from 19.7 years to 49.2 years. 
 
 
 IMT/DMT fMRI protocol 
 The immediate memory task (IMT) and delayed memory task (DMT) protocol ( Dougherty et al., 2002 ;  Dougherty et al., 1998 ;  Moeller et al., 2004 ;  Moeller et al., 2010 ) was used as the working memory test. The IMT and DMT are delayed-matching-to-sample ( Fuster, 2008 ) tasks ( Figure 1 ). In both IMT and DMT, each stimulus consists of a string of numbers that is displayed for 0.5 s, followed by an inter-stimulus interval of 0.5 s, at a rate of 1 stimulus per second. In DMT, the target and probe stimuli are separated by distracter stimuli, consisting of a string of all zeros (e.g., 00000) that is repeated three times at the same rate and duration as the target and probe stimuli ( Figure 1 ). Thus, in DMT, the memory delay between the end of the target stimulus and beginning of the probe stimulus is 3.5 s. In IMT, there are no distracter stimuli, and thus the memory delay between target and probe is 0.5 s. A non-salient stimulus consisting of all ones (e.g., 11111) is presented once after each DMT trial and four times after each IMT trial ( Figure 1 ). Therefore the sum of the distracter stimuli and the non-salient inter-trial stimuli is the same (four) during DMT and IMT conditions, and hence the number of trials is same (seven) for IMT blocks and DMT blocks. 
 In both IMT and DMT, the probability of a match and the probability of a catch are both 50%. In a catch, the probe differs from the target in only one of the digits. Subjects were instructed to press a button using the right index finger only when the probe matches the target. The A’ score ( Donaldson 1992 ;  Pollack and Norman 1964 ) is used as an accuracy measure. The A’ ranges from 0.5 to 1.0, corresponding to chance to perfect discriminability respectively. 
 The IMT/DMT fMRI protocol is a block design. There are 12 blocks alternating between IMT and DMT within each run. The number of digits in the stimulus string can be 3, 5, or 7 and is held constant within each block. The digit-length conditions represent three levels of digit load. All digit conditions are presented within each run, in counterbalanced order between runs and subjects. The duration of each block is 42.5 s; there is 10 s rest between blocks and 20 s rest at the beginning of each run. 
 
 
 Data acquisition 
 MRI data, including three-dimensional spoiled gradient recalled echo (3D-SPGR), fMRI, and FLAIR, were acquired on a Philips 3.0 T Intera system with a six-channel receive head coil (Philips Medical Systems, Best, Netherlands). Single shot spin-echo echoplanar imaging EPI was used for acquiring the fMRI data. The spin echo EPI sequence reduces signal losses caused by through-slice dephasing in medial orbitofrontal cortex ( Kruger et al., 2001 ;  Norris et al., 2002 ;  Wang et al., 2004 ). The fMRI acquisition parameters were: SENSE factor=2.0, repetition time=2212 ms, echo time=75 ms, flip angle=90°, number of axial slices=22, field-of-view=240 mm × 240 mm, in-plane resolution=3.75 mm × 3.75 mm, slice thickness=3.75 mm, gap=1.25 mm, repetitions=294 after 10 dummy acquisitions, run duration=10 min 47 s. Each subject had 2 runs of fMRI scans. Stimulus presentation and recording of behavioral IMT/DMT performance data during fMRI scanning were managed through the Integrated Functional Imaging System-Stand Alone (IFIS-SA) fMRI system (9 subjects) or the Eloquence update of IFIS-SA (9 subjects) fMRI Systems (Invivo Corporation, Orlando, Florida). In the IFIS-SA system, the subjects used a glove-like button response unit, and the resolution of the liquid-crystal display video (built into the head coil) was 640 × 480. In the Eloquence system, the subjects used a keyboard-like button response unit, and the resolution of the liquid-crystal display video (built into the head coil) was 1024 × 768. In both systems, the subject responded to the task by pressing a button with the right index finger. The software controlling the task was exactly the same in both systems. Using both systems, we ascertained that each subject could see the task adequately on the screen prior to the start of the fMRI scan. 
 
 
 fMRI preprocessing 
 Preprocessing of the fMRI data was performed with AFNI ( Cox 1996 ), and with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8) software from the Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK, implemented in Matlab 7.1 (MathWorks Inc., Natick, Massachusetts). Preprocessing consisted of examination for artifacts using AFNI, and slice-timing correction, realignment, coregistration, normalization, and smoothing using SPM8. Please see the  Supplementary Materials  for details of the preprocessing. 
 
 
 Univariate fMRI statistical parametric mapping analysis 
 First-level univariate statistical analysis of the fMRI data was conducted using SPM8. The IMT and DMT blocks for each digit condition were modeled by boxcar functions convolved with the SPM canonical hemodynamic response function. The parameters for each condition were estimated using the General Linear Model ( Friston 1995b ) at each voxel without global normalization. The fMRI time series was high-pass filtered with a cut-off period of 330 s determined by the Fourier transformation of each condition’s time model, which showed that signal from the experimental condition was retained at this value, and that shorter cut-off periods would eliminate most of the signal from the experimental condition. Activation for each digit condition was defined as the contrast of DMT minus IMT parameter estimates (“DI”) for that digit condition (i.e., DI3, DI5, and DI7 for 3, 5, and 7 digit conditions respectively). The DI3, DI5, and DI7 summary contrast images were output for each subject for entry into the second-level analysis. 
 The main effect of the digit load and planned comparisons between the digit-load conditions were analyzed using SPM8 univariate second-level (random effects) full factorial analysis. The full factorial module included a digit load factor with three levels (DI3, DI5, and DI7). Planned comparisons between digits were: DI7 minus DI5, DI5 minus DI7, DI7 minus DI3, DI3 minus DI7, DI5 minus DI3, and DI3 minus DI5. 
 For all analyses, the cluster-defining threshold was t = 2.4. All the P values resulting from the fMRI analysis reported in this paper are cluster P values that were corrected for multiple comparisons using Random Field Theory, computed by SPM8 to control the family-wise error (FWE) rate to be less than 0.05 ( Friston et al., 1994 ). Approximate anatomical labels for regions of activation were determined using the Anatomical Automatic Labeling ( Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002 ) toolbox for SPM. 
 
 
 Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) 
 
 Bilinear DCM and nonlinear extension 
 DCM8 ( Friston et al., 2003 ;  Stephan et al., 2007a ), as implemented in SPM8 (revision 3684), was used for effective connectivity analysis. In DCM for fMRI, the dynamics of the neural states underlying the BOLD response are modeled by a differential state equation that describes how the neural states change with the current neural states, the contextual conditions, and the driving inputs ( Friston et al., 2003 ;  Stephan et al., 2007a ). In this differential equation, the interactions between the neural states are termed as endogenous connections and quantified by A parameters. The influences of the contextual conditions are termed as modulations and quantified by B parameters, and the influences of the driving inputs are quantified by C parameters ( Friston et al., 2003 ;  Stephan et al., 2007a ). The modeled neuronal dynamics are input to a hemodynamic model, which transforms the neuronal dynamics into predicted BOLD responses ( Friston et al., 2003 ;  Stephan et al., 2007a ). The parameters of a DCM are optimized using a variational Bayesian scheme that effectively minimizes the difference between predicted and observed BOLD signals under complexity constraints ( Friston et al., 2003 ;  Stephan et al., 2007a ). These schemes provide the posterior or conditional estimates of the DCM parameters and a free energy approximation to the model’s log evidence ( Friston et al., 2003 ;  Stephan et al., 2007a ). It has been shown that DCM is stable in performance ( Schuyler et al., 2010 ), and appropriate for study of clinical populations ( Rowe et al., 2010 ). Since the publication of the seminal DCM paper ( Friston et al., 2003 ), DCM has been applied in a variety of studies (e.g.,  Allen et al., 2010 ;  Benetti et al., 2009 ;  Bitan et al., 2005 ;  Booth et al., 2008 ;  Kumar et al., 2007 ;  Plailly et al., 2008 ;  Schlosser et al., 2010 ;  Smith et al., 2006 ;  Wang et al., 2010 ). In addition to the DCM using a bilinear differential equation (“bilinear” DCM), a non-linear extension by  Stephan et al. (2008)  has recently been implemented in SPM8. Using non-linear DCM, one can evaluate if the interaction between two regions is gated by a specifically defined third region. 
 
 
 Region of interest selection 
 The regions of interest for the DCM analyses in this study were: left (L) and right (R) MFG, L and R IFC, L and R ACC, and L and R PPC. These regions were chosen based on the following rationale: (1) these regions showed significant activation in the univariate SPM second level full factorial analysis, either in the main effect of memory delay or the planned comparisons between the digit conditions; (2) previous meta-analyses of neuroimaging studies have shown that these regions activate consistently during working memory tasks ( Owen et al., 2005 ;  Wager and Smith 2003 ); (3) these regions have been regarded as being involved in working memory processes, e.g., encoding ( Woodward et al., 2006 ), storage ( Hartley and Speer 2000 ), maintenance ( Hartley and Speer 2000 ;  Woodward et al., 2006 ), and executive control ( Hartley and Speer 2000 ). 
 
 
 Volumes of interest and time series extraction 
 We used the significant group level activation clusters to determine the volumes of interest (VOIs) for this study, which were further constrained to be within the boundaries of the aforementioned eight regions of interest, as defined by anatomical atlases ( Stephan et al., 2010 ). The atlas-derived binary masks of the eight regions of interest were obtained from the Anatomical Automatic Labeling atlas ( Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002 ) as implemented in the WFU (Wake Forest University) PickAtlas SPM toolbox ( Maldjian et al., 2004 ;  Maldjian et al., 2003 ). The binary mask of IFC was the set-theoretic union of the atlas-based binary masks of inferior frontal gyrus pars opercularis and inferior frontal gyrus pars triangularis. The binary mask of PPC was the union of the atlas-based binary masks of superior parietal lobule and inferior parietal lobule. Each VOI was obtained by the intersection of the atlas-based binary masks and the significant activation clusters found in the SPM second level full factorial group analysis. In detail, the L MFG, R MFG, L ACC, and R ACC VOIs were obtained as the intersection between their atlas-based binary masks (separately for L and R) and the activation clusters from the planned comparisons between digit conditions ( Supplementary Figure 1 ). L IFC, R IFC, L PPC, and R PPC were obtained as the intersection between their atlases-based binary masks (separately for L and R) and the significant activation clusters from the main effect of memory delay ( Supplementary Figure 1 ). For each subject, the time series from the first-level analysis for that subject was extracted from all voxels within the VOI, and the principal eigenvariate ( Stephan et al., 2010 ) of this time series, which was adjusted for effects of interest, was input into DCM for model estimation. The same VOIs were used for all subjects. 
 
 
 Endogenous connections 
 In the DCMs, full endogenous connections were specified among all the regions of interest ( Supplementary Figure 2 ). In other words, there exist two connections between any two regions of interest (e.g., X and Y) and the connections are bi-directional: one is from X to Y, and another is from Y to X. Thus, the same 56 endogenous connections were used in each DCM in all subsequent analyses. 
 
 
 Specification of exogenous inputs 
 We used Bayesian model selection (BMS) to choose the regions that received driving inputs. This involved inverting alternative models (where the effects of inputs were varied systematically) and choosing the optimal model for subsequent analysis of the quantitative changes in connectivity due to experimental effects. In brief, we used a heuristic model optimization strategy in which we considered increasingly complicated models, based upon the model with the highest evidence at each level of complexity. As described in Results, we started with optimizing the direct inputs (controlled by the C parameters) and then turned to the modulation of connectivity (controlled by the B parameters) at one or multiple connections. Having established the optimal model at the group level, we then used the parameters of this model to test for the effects of memory load at the group level. This is exactly analogous to the usual approach to multi-subject studies in fMRI using the summary statistic procedure. In our case, our (per subject) summaries were simply the conditional estimates of modulation effects, under the optimal model. 
 The locations where the driving inputs entered into the DCM were optimized using BMS. The BMS is an established procedure for selecting an optimal model from alternative DCMs ( Penny et al., 2004 ;  Stephan et al., 2009 ). This is realized by comparing model evidence ( Friston et al., 2007 ;  MacKay 1992 ;  Penny et al., 2004 ;  Stephan et al., 2009 ), which simultaneously quantifies how accurately a model explains (or fits) the data and how complex this model is. An “optimal” model is the model with best tradeoff between model fitting (more accurate) and model complexity (less complex), among all the alternative models. In this study, we chose the random effects approach for Bayesian model selection, which accounts for heterogeneity of model structure across subjects ( Stephan et al., 2009 ). The exceedance probability ( Stephan et al., 2009 ) was used to select the optimal model from a group of candidate models. The exceedance probability for a given model denotes the probability that this model was more likely to have generated the observed data than any other model considered. This estimate is derived by considering the model evidence, a Bayesian measure of model goodness that trades-off model accuracy and model fit and reflects the generalizability of the model. Recently BMS has been extended so that one can use Bayesian family level inference (BFLI) to select the optimal family from several candidate families of DCMs ( Penny et al., 2010 ). 
 
 
 Group level DCM analysis 
 Once the optimal DCM was established, the parameters of the optimal DCM were gathered from all subjects to conduct the group level DCM analysis, using classical (“Frequentist”) statistical analysis. The group level DCM analysis was also conducted using Bayesian model averaging (BMA) ( Penny et al., 2010 ), which is less dependent on assumptions about model structure at the group level. BMA (as implemented in SPM8) is a Bayesian approach that averages each parameter across models (and across subjects) such that the contribution of each model (of each subject) for that parameter is weighted by the model’s posterior probability.

 Statistical analyses 
 Student’s t-test was used to evaluate differences between two samples of continuous variables. Statistical analysis of the behavioral accuracy scores (A’) has a within subjects factor of memory delay (IMT versus DMT), and a within subjects factor of digit load (3 digits, 5 digits and 7 digits). Linear mixed models analysis, as implemented in SPSS Version 19 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois) for Windows (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, Washington), was used to analyze the main effects of the two factors and their interaction. If main effects or interaction was statistically significant, then post-hoc analyses were conducted with false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons, using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina) multtest procedure. Similar analysis was conducted for the DCM modulation parameters. Associations between the modulation effects and behavior accuracy scores (A’) were evaluated using nonparametric Spearman correlation (Matlab 7.1). 
 
 
 
 RESULTS 
 
 Behavior during fMRI scanning 
 The mean and standard error of the subjects’ behavioral accuracy scores (A’) during different digit loads and memory delays are summarized in  Table I . The linear mixed model analysis of the A’ has a within subjects factor of memory delay (IMT versus DMT), and a within subjects factor of digit load (3 digits, 5 digits and 7 digits). The linear mixed model analysis revealed statistically significant main effects of digit load (F = 26.16; df = 2, 49.79; P < 0.001). The main effects of memory delay (IMT and DMT) (F = 0.06; df = 1, 61.07; P = 0.81) and the interaction effect (F = 0.17; df = 2, 49.79; P = 0.84) were not statistically significant. Post-hoc comparisons showed that A’ during 7 digits was significantly lower than A’ during 5 digits (P < 0.001, corrected) and significantly lower than A’ during 3 digits (P < 0.001, corrected). In addition, A’ during 5 digits was significantly lower than A’ during 3 digits (P = 0.002, corrected). The mean and standard error of the subjects’ A’ scores, averaged across both memory delay conditions (IMT and DMT) during different digit loads are shown in  Figure 3 . 
 
 
 SPM univariate analysis of fMRI 
 The univariate SPM second-level full-factorial analysis of the fMRI data revealed four significant clusters (after family-wise error correction) for the main effect of the delayed minus immediate memory conditions pooled across 3, 5, and 7 digits per stimulus (DI 3, 5, and 7) ( Table II  and  Figure 4 ). In addition, a significant cluster was found for the DI7 minus DI5 planned comparison, and a significant cluster was found for the DI3 minus DI5 planned comparison. No significant clusters were found for the other planned comparisons (DI7 minus DI3, DI3 minus DI7, DI5 minus DI3, and DI5 minus DI7). For each of the significant clusters, the cluster-level family-wise error (FWE) corrected P value, cluster volume, mean difference in activation across all voxels in cluster, and the MNI coordinates of the voxel with maximal t value are listed in  Table II . The approximate anatomical labels of the significant clusters are listed in the Supplementary Materials. 
 
 
 DCM analysis 
 The number of voxels, volume, and center of mass of the eight VOIs are listed in  Table III . The neuro-anatomical location of the eight VOIs are illustrated in  Supplementary Figure 3 . Based on our fMRI experimental design, which was a factorial paradigm with a factor of memory delay duration (IMT: 0.5 s and DMT: 3.5 s conditions) and a factor of digit load (3, 5, and 7 digits per stimulus), we studied three input model families (IMF): separate IMT and DMT inputs (IMF 1), collapsed IMT/DMT input (IMF 2), and separate 3, 5, and 7 digits inputs (IMF 3), corresponding to IMF 1, IMF 2, and IMF 3 respectively in  Supplementary Figure 4 . It should be noted that collapsed IMT and DMT is also mathematically equivalent to collapsed digit load. In each of the three input model families, the driving inputs were analyzed to determine whether they entered the DCMs at the following driving locations: bilateral MFG, bilateral IFC, bilateral ACC, or bilateral PPC. With full endogenous connections ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) and without specifying the modulation of the experimental conditions, the DCMs were estimated for each of the four driving locations for all subjects within each input model family. Random effects Bayesian model selection (BMS) within each input family revealed that the model with the driving location at the bilateral PPC had an exceedance probability that was much greater (Φ=0.9652, Φ=0.9996, and Φ=0.8911 respectively) within each of the three input model families than the exceedance probabilities of the other driving locations ( Supplementary Figure 5 ). Therefore the driving location was set to bilateral PPC in all subsequent DCM analyses. 
 Based on the optimal driving input location, six model families were tested to find optimal driving and modulation types: Family F1 with separate IMT and DMT as the driving inputs (C parameters) and three levels of digit load as the modulators (B parameters); Family F2 with three levels of digit load as the driving inputs and separate IMT and DMT as the modulators; Family F3 with collapsed IMT/DMT as the driving input and three levels of digit load as the modulators; Family F4 with three levels of digit load as the driving inputs and collapsed IMT/DMT as the modulator; Family F5 with separate IMT and DMT as the driving inputs and collapsed IMT/DMT as the modulator; Family F6 with collapsed IMT/DMT as the driving input and separate IMT and DMT as the modulators. All model families are shown schematically in  Figure 5 . In each input/modulation model family, all 56 DCMs had the same driving location (bilateral PPC) (found in the previous step to be the optimal input location). All 56 DCMs had full endogenous connections, and it was postulated that only one of the 56 endogenous connections was modulated by the contextual condition in each of the 56 DCMs. The only difference among the 56 DCMs is which endogenous connection is modulated by the contextual condition. All 56 models were estimated for all subjects and all 6 model families. Random effects Bayesian family level inference (BFLI) ( Penny et al., 2010 ) on the six modulation model families revealed that the model family (F3) with collapsed IMT/DMT as the driving input and the three levels of digit load as the modulators ( Figure 5 ) is the optimal model family among the six candidate model families (exceedance probability Φ=0.9431,  Figure 6A ). 
 The following is a description of the heuristic search strategy to further optimize the model for creating the summary statistics. Based on the model family F3 ( Figure 5 ) in which the type of driving input and the type of modulator were optimized ( Figure 6A ), we used BMS and BFLI to test whether digit load modulated a single connection or multiple connections. As a first step, we conducted random effects BMS within the optimal family (F3) that was obtained in the previous step. The BMS results revealed that digit load modulating the connection from R PPC to L PPC had the largest exceedance probability (Φ=0.316). However there were several other models that each had an exceedance probability for the modulation effect that was approximately at least 5 times larger than in the majority of the models ( Figure 6B  and  Table IV ). 
 These preliminary BMS results suggested the possibility that digit load modulated multiple connections in the same model rather than a single connection. To reduce the resource-intensive search over model space, we chose a criterion that the exceedance probability of a single modulation effect should be greater than 0.025 (i.e., approximately at least 5 times greater than the exceedance probability of the majority of models) in order to be selected for inclusion in a putative multiple modulation model. This is an ad hoc criterion that can be viewed as part of the heuristic search that allowed us to explore the space of all possible models in a manageable and systematic way. Among the 56 single modulation models, 6 models satisfied this criterion: R PPC → L ACC, L PPC → L IFC, R PPC → R IFC, R PPC → L MFG, R PPC → R MFG, and R PPC → L PPC (Here X → Y denotes connection from X to Y). Based on the aforementioned selection criterion, we constructed a putative bilinear multiple modulation model ( Figure 7 ), in which digit load modulated all six connections in the same model, and in which the same endogenous connections and inputs were specified as in the single modulation models. This multiple modulation model was estimated for all subjects. 
 To evaluate the multiple modulation model at the group level, we conducted several steps of BFLI. First we conducted a family comparison of single vs. multiple modulation effects. The bilinear single modulation family (comprised of the 56 bilinear modulation models in which digit load modulated a single connection in each model) was compared to the bilinear multiple modulation model. This random effects BFLI confirmed that the bilinear multiple modulation model had a overwhelmingly superior exceedance probability (Φ=0.9999) than the family of 56 single bilinear modulation models (Φ=0.0001) ( Figure 6C ). 
 Next, we used nonlinear DCM to test if the parieto-frontal connections in the bilinear multiple modulation model were gated by a top-down control mechanism ( Frith 2001 ;  Gazzaley and D’Esposito 2007 ;  Johnston et al., 2007 ). After constructing a nonlinear DCM family (please see  Supplementary Materials  for detailed information), we then conducted a bilinear vs. nonlinear BFLI: the bilinear family (comprised of the 56 bilinear modulation models in which digit load modulated a single connection plus a 57th model, which was the bilinear multiple modulation model) was compared to the nonlinear family (comprised of 3 single and 1 multiple nonlinear models). The random effects BFLI revealed that the bilinear family (Φ=0.9470) had a greater exceedance probability than the nonlinear family (Φ=0.0530) ( Figure 6D ). Thus, our heuristic search procedures revealed that the optimal DCM was the bilinear multiple modulation model ( Figure 7 ) rather than single or nonlinear models. 
 The modulation parameters (B parameters) obtained from Bayesian model averaging across all subjects and all 56 bilinear single modulation models are shown in  Figure 8  and  Supplementary Table I . Bayesian model averaging showed that the six connections in the bilinear multiple modulation model were among the connections with the greatest modulation effects of digit load. There was a positive modulation effect on the connection from L PPC to L IFC exerted by the 7-digit working memory load ( Figure 8 ). In addition, there was a negative modulation effect on the connection from R PPC to L ACC exerted by the 3-digit load ( Figure 8 ). These two findings were consistent with the results of the secondary classical (frequentist) analysis and the exploratory analysis of the modulation effects. Please see  Supplementary Materials  for the results of secondary classical (frequentist) analysis, exploratory analysis, and exploratory correlation analysis with behavioral performance. 
 
 
 
 DISCUSSION 
 To evaluate the modulation effects of memory load on the effective connectivity of working memory, we conducted a DCM analysis of the fMRI data acquired from 18 healthy subjects while they performed a working memory task with three levels of digit load (3, 5, and 7 digits per stimulus) and two levels of memory delay (IMT: 0.5 s and DMT: 3.5 s). We used a heuristic Bayesian model selection strategy in which we considered increasingly complicated models, based upon the model with the highest evidence at each level of complexity. 
 The primary result of the inference on model structure showed that the optimal DCM was a bilinear model in which the driving input (C parameters) is the collapsed working memory delay (collapsed IMT/DMT input), and the modulator (B parameters) is digit load, as opposed to models with alternative combinations of input and modulation (exceedance probability Φ=0.9431). The bilinear multiple modulation DCM, in which 6 different connections were modulated by the contextual condition of digit load, had greater exceedance probability than the single modulation DCM family (Φ=0.9999) and nonlinear DCM family (Φ=0.9470). Thus, random effects DCM inference on model structure objectively confirmed that the optimal model consisted of digit load modulating a system of several connections among regions of interest in the putative working memory neuronal system. In spite of the built-in penalty for greater complexity in the Bayesian selection procedure because of multiple connections, this model had a clearly superior exceedance probability and thus the best balance between accuracy and complexity among the alternative models, and hence affords maximum generalizability ( Pitt and Myung, 2002 ;  Stephan et al., 2010 ). 
 In the optimal model, the optimal driving location was the bilateral PPC rather than the frontal regions of interest, suggesting that the PPC was involved with an earlier stage of visual signal processing than frontal brain regions. This result is consistent with previous studies showing that the PPC connects to visual areas ( Baizer et al., 1991 ) and plays an essential role in the early visual signal processing ( Andersen 1989 ;  Nakashita et al., 2008 ). 
 The digit load modulated several connections from PPC to prefrontal regions; this result supports a recent model which proposes that working memory is represented by networks of neurons consisting of interactive frontal and posterior association regions ( Fuster 2006 ;  Fuster 2008 ;  Fuster 2009 ). In addition, this result is consistent with previous functional connectivity studies showing that the frontoparietal network is affected by working memory load ( Palva et al., 2010 ;  Payne and Kounios, 2009 ;  Woodward et al., 2006 ). 
 There was a positive modulation effect on the connection from L PPC to L IFC exerted by the 7-digit working memory load ( Figure 8 ,  Supplementary Figure 7 , and  Supplementary Table II ). These results are consistent with the findings by  Rypma et al. (1999)  and  Veltman et al. (2003)  showing that memory load enhanced activation in left inferior frontal gyrus. A dominance of left hemisphere in verbal working memory has been demonstrated by previous neuroimaging studies ( Awh et al., 1995 ;  Binder and Urbanik 2006 ;  Oztekin et al., 2009 ;  Wager and Smith 2003 ). Correspondingly, it has been hypothesized that verbal working memory mainly activates left hemisphere ( D’Arcy et al., 2004 ;  Gabrieli et al., 1998 ;  Smith and Jonides 1999 ). Therefore we speculate that the connection from L PPC to L IFC under the present study conditions is related to processing of verbal information. This speculation is consistent with the theory of  Dehaene et al. (2003)  regarding the parietal circuits for number processing. According to  Dehaene et al. (2003) , the connection from left angular gyrus area, which is part of inferior parietal lobule ( Eidelberg and Galaburda 1984 ), to other left-hemispheric perisylvian areas (e.g., Broca’s area, which is typically defined in terms of the pars opercularis and pars triangularis of the inferior frontal gyrus [ Dronkers et al., 2007 ]) supports the manipulation of numbers in verbal form. Based on the evidence showing that PPC and IFC are working memory load dependent (e.g.,  Kirschen et al., 2005 ;  Narayanan et al., 2005 ;  Ravizza et al., 2004 ;  Woodward et al., 2006 ) and the theory proposing that PPC has a function of phonological store and IFC has a function of subvocal rehearsal ( Awh et al., 1996 ;  Awh et al., 1995 ;  Baddeley 2000 ;  Hartley and Speer 2000 ;  Jonides et al., 1998 ;  Nixon et al., 2004 ;  Paulesu et al., 1993 ;  Smith and Jonides 1998 ), we further speculate that one of the functions of the connection from L PPC to L IFC under the present study conditions is for maintenance of verbal information. The increased digit load enhanced this connection, perhaps reflecting increased requirement of verbal signal processing when the digit load increased. 
 There was a negative modulation effect on the connection from R PPC to L ACC exerted by the 3-digit load ( Figure 8 ,  Supplementary Figure 7 , and  Supplementary Table II ). These results suggest that the connection from R PPC to L ACC was inhibited during 3 digits (but not by 5 or 7 digits). Based on the role of ACC in detecting conditions under which errors are likely to occur ( Carter et al., 1998 ) and the relatively low probability of performance error in the condition of 3 digits, we speculate that the negative modulation effect exerted by 3 digits is due to low necessity of error monitoring during low digit load. 
 Honey et al. (2002)  found a memory-load enhanced connection from L MFG to R MFG, which was not found in the present study. This difference may be due to the differences in methods used by the two studies: (1)  Honey et al. (2002)  used n-back working memory task, while we used IMT/DMT working memory task. (2) Apart from the same regions of interest (bilateral MFG, IFC, and PPC) used in the two studies,  Honey et al. (2002)  also used supplementary motor area (SMA) as a region of interest, while we used bilateral ACC as regions of interest because we found significant activation in bilateral ACC but did not find significant activation in SMA in the group level univariate SPM analysis. (3) The structural equation modeling used by  Honey et al. (2002)  operated on the observed hemodynamic level, while the DCM used in the present study operated on the underlying neuronal level ( Friston et al., 2003 ;  Stephan et al., 2007a ). (4) In  Honey et al. (2002) , the modulation effects of memory load were indirectly evaluated by dividing the data into condition-specific subsets and applying separate structural equation modeling to each subset, and their optimal model only fitted 1-back and 2-back conditions, but did not fit 3-back condition; in the present study, the modulation effects of the digit load were directly measured by DCM in all three digit conditions. 
 Please see  Supplementary Materials  for additional discussion regarding the methodology of selecting the VOIs in this study, regarding the results of behavioral analysis, regarding the results of the univariate SPM analysis, and regarding the secondary classical analysis of the parameters of the optimal DCM at the group level. 
 
 Limitations. 
 One limitation of the present study is that the working memory task paradigm used here is a block-design; thus we cannot distinguish the specific working memory component processes in which the observed modulation effects occurred. In addition, correct as well as incorrect responses were necessarily included in each block because of the standard block-design fMRI analysis. An event-related design, in which different component processes and correct and incorrect responses are modeled separately, would be needed to answer these questions. Next, given the lack of established criterion, we chose a post-hoc criterion that the exceedance probability of a single connection modulation effect should be greater than 0.025 (approximately five times the exceedance probablility of the majority of single-connection modulation models tested) in order to be selected for inclusion in the multiple modulation model. Although this criterion is arbitrary, the multiple modulation model based on this criterion conveys potentially useful information about the modulation effects as evidenced by the Bayesian model averaging results ( Figure 8 ,  Supplementary Table I ) and the clearly greater exceedance probability (Φ=0.9999) than the single modulation DCM family. Thirdly, it is possible that different sets of ROIs may be more appropriate for other working memory tasks that are different from the task used in the present study. Fourthly, the “optimal” model obtained from BMS or BFLI only suggests that this model has the best tradeoff between accuracy and model complexity among a limited group of alternative comparison models; it does not necessarily represent the actual neural system ( Stephan et al., 2010 ). Another limitation in this study is that only one fMRI run per subject was included in the analysis, which may have caused a limitation in power. However, the significant random-effects univariate activation findings, the clearly superior exceedance probability of the results of random-effects Bayesian family level inference that showed bilinear modulation by the digit load factor, and the significant random-effects (SPSS linear mixed-model) findings for the modulatory effects of digit load at the group level (please see the  Supplementary Materials  for the secondary analysis of the modulatory effects of digit load at the group level) were all able to overcome the potential limitation in power due to only one fMRI run per subject being included in the analysis. One possible reason for the robustness of these findings in overcoming the potential limitation in power, may be related to the suggestion that the statistical power in a random effects fMRI group analysis usually depends more heavily on the number of subjects than the number of scans per subject ( Friston et al., 2002 ;  Henson, 2007 ), particularly given that inter-subject variability tends to exceed inter-scan variability ( Henson, 2007 ). 
 Several of the above limitations reflect the difficulties in exploring model spaces exhaustively, given the combinatorics of connections and their modulation by exogenous (experimental) effects. We have tried to finesse this problem using a heuristic strategy that provided a comprehensive survey of potential models; however, advances in large model searches ( Friston et al., In Press ) may, in the future, relax some of the limitations we were subject to.

 Figure 1 
 
 Immediate memory task (IMT) and delayed memory task (DMT). 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 2 
 
 Flowchart of DCM analysis procedure. ROI = region of interest, VOI = volume of interest, BMS = Bayesian model selection, BFLI = Bayesian family level inference, and BMA = Bayesian model averaging. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 3 
 
 Mean and standard error of the subjects’ performance (A’), averaged across the memory delays (IMT and DMT), during different digit loads (3, 5, and 7 digits per stimulus). A’ at 7 digits was significantly less than the A’ at 3 digits (P < 0.001, corrected) and 5 digits (P < 0.001, corrected). A’ at 5 digits was significantly less than the A’ at 3 digits (P = 0.002, corrected). Error bars denote standard errors. Significant differences are indicated by asterisks. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 4 
 
 Significant clusters (after family-wise error correction) of brain activation from the univariate SPM second-level full-factorial general linear model analysis. Brain activations are overlaid in color on axial slices of the MNI template brain. The number above each slice indicates slice location (mm) of MNI z coordinate. Scale on color bar represents voxel t values. Left (L) side of each slice is left hemisphere of the brain, and right (R) side of each slice is right hemisphere of brain. A (top panel): main effect of the delayed minus immediate memory conditions pooled across 3, 5, and 7 digits per stimulus (DI 3, 5, and 7); B (middle panel): DI7 minus DI5 planned comparison; C (lower panel): DI3 minus DI5 planned comparison. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 5 
 
 The six bilinear single modulation DCM families. In each model family, the driving input location was bilateral PPC, as denoted by the dotted lines with arrow. The endogenous connections among the regions of interest were all bi-directional. There were 56 DCMs in each model family, and the only difference among these 56 models is which endogenous connection was modulated by the contextual conditions. Only one example model is shown for each model family. The endogenous connection is depicted by solid line with arrow, and modulation effect is depicted by thin line ending with solid dot. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 6 
 
 Random-effects BMS and BFLI results. (A) BFLI results on the six modulation model families, for optimal input type and modulation type. Please see  Figure 5  for the details of the modulation model families. (B) BMS results within the optimal single modulation model family F3, for testing if there was an optimal single modulation model. The Collapsed IMT/DMT input entered the DCM through bilateral PPC, and it was postulated that digit load (3, 5, and 7 digits per stimulus) modulated a single connection in each of the 56 models ( Table 4 ). The dashed line denotes the (arbitrary) post-hoc threshold exceedance probability (Φ = 0.025) of at least 5 times the exceedance probability of the majority of the other models, which was used to select the modulated connections to be included in the multiple modulation model for subsequent analysis. (C) BFLI (Single vs. Multiple), for testing if the multiple modulation model was optimal vs. the single modulation model family F3: the Single family (comprised of the 56 bilinear modulation models in which digit load modulated a single connection in each model) was compared to the bilinear multiple modulation model. (D) BFLI (Bilinear vs. Nonlinear), for testing if the multiple modulation model was optimal vs. the nonlinear modulation model family: the Bilinear family (comprised of the 56 bilinear modulation models in which digit load modulated a single connection in each model, plus a 57th model which was the bilinear multiple modulation model) was compared to the Nonlinear family (comprised of the four nonlinear models). 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 7 
 
 The optimal bilinear multiple modulation DCM. The Collapsed IMT/DMT input entered the model through bilateral PPC, as denoted by the dotted lines with arrow. The endogenous connections among the regions of interest were all bi-directional. Only the six uni-directional endogenous connections with modulation effects exerted by digit load are shown for purpose of visual clarity. The endogenous connections are depicted by solid lines with arrows, and modulation effects are depicted by thin lines ending with solid dots. Double plus sign and double minus sign respectively denote the most positive modulatory effect and the most negative modulatory effect. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 8 
 
 Bayesian model averaging results on modulation parameters across all subjects for each of the 56 bilinear single modulation models, which is less dependent on the assumption of the model structure. (A) 3 digits; (B) 5 digits; and (C) 7 digits. The six connections included in the multiple modulation model correspond to six of the eight connections with the greatest modulation parameters in this Figure which are labeled by the connection numbers. The six connections included in the optimal multiple modulation model are connection number 7: R PPC → L ACC; connection number 20: L PPC → L IFC; connection number 28: R PPC → R IFC; connection number 35: R PPC → L MFG; connection number 42: R PPC → R MFG; and connection number 49: R PPC → L PPC. ME=modulation effect.
