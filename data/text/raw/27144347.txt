 Background 
 Major depressive disorder is a disabling neuropsychiatric condition that is associated with disrupted functional connectivity across brain networks. The precise nature of altered connectivity, however, remains incompletely understood. The current study was designed to examine the coherence of large-scale connectivity in depression using a recently developed technique termed global brain connectivity. 
 
 
 Methods 
 A total of 82 subjects, including medication-free patients with major depression (n=57) and healthy volunteers (n=25) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging with resting data acquisition for functional connectivity analysis. Global brain connectivity was computed as the mean of each voxel’s time series correlation with every other voxel and compared between study groups. Relationships between global connectivity and depressive symptom severity measured using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale were examined by means of linear correlation. 
 
 
 Results 
 Relative to the healthy group, patients with depression evidenced reduced global connectivity bilaterally within multiple regions of medial and lateral prefrontal cortex. The largest between-group difference was observed within the right subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, extending into ventromedial prefrontal cortex bilaterally (Hedges’ g = −1.48, p<0.000001). Within the depressed group, patients with the lowest connectivity evidenced the highest symptom severity within ventromedial prefrontal cortex (r = −0.47, p=0.0005). 
 
 
 Conclusions 
 Patients with major depressive evidenced abnormal large-scale functional coherence in the brain that was centered within the subgenual cingulate cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex more broadly. These data extend prior studies of connectivity in depression and demonstrate that functional disconnection of the medial prefrontal cortex is a key pathological feature of the disorder.

 INTRODUCTION 
 Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by pervasive disturbances in mood regulation, reward sensitivity, cognitive control and neurovegetative functioning. Unipolar depressive disorders are associated with more disability-adjusted life-years lost than any other brain-based disorder, including all other psychiatric disorders and all neurological and substance use disorders ( Collins et al., 2011 ). Although the fundamental pathology underlying MDD or its component features remains elusive, significant progress has been made in characterizing abnormalities in depression at the level of neural system ( Hamilton et al., 2012 ;  Price and W. C. Drevets, 2010 ). Behavioral neuroscience and neuroimaging studies provide convergent evidence for disordered functioning within distributed neural systems encompassing ventral, medial and lateral aspects of prefrontal cortex (PFC), rostral and ventral aspects of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and interconnected subcortical regions ( Hamilton et al., 2012 ;  Price and W. C. Drevets, 2010 ;  Siegle et al., 2007 ). The ventromedial PFC (VMPFC) and subgenual ACC (sgACC) in particular feature prominently in neurocircuit models of depression ( Mayberg et al., 2005 ). 
 Techniques for computing functional connectivity based on analysis of low frequency fluctuations of the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal at rest ( Fox and M. E. Raichle, 2007 ) have enabled important advances in the understanding of human brain function in vivo in MDD and other neuropsychiatric conditions ( Kaiser et al., 2015 ;  Sheline et al., 2010 ). Prior studies in depression have partially converged on the ACC and other midline cortical structures have shown abnormal functional connectivity, although there is significant heterogeneity of findings in the literature and the precise nature of the alternations in connectivity that characterize MDD remain incompletely understood ( Kaiser et al., 2015 ). Contributing to this uncertainty, most research to date examining functional connectivity has relied on the  a priori  selection of “seed” regions by the investigator; this method involves determining to which brain area connectivity will be measured and therefore inherently restricts the interpretation of the results. This approach is useful for testing hypotheses regarding specific regions or networks but does not provide a comprehensive method of examining connectivity outside of pre-specified regions ( Fox and M. E. Raichle, 2007 ). 
 In order to further characterize the nature of functional connectivity alterations in MDD, in the current study we applied a recently developed measure of connectivity based on graph theory termed global brain connectivity (GBC) ( Anticevic et al., 2013 ;  Anticevic et al., 2014 ;  Cole et al., 2010 ). Global brain connectivity provides a measure of the connectivity, or coherence, of all voxels in the brain relative to all other voxels. In the context of graph theory, GBC can be considered as weighted degree centrality normalized to the total number of possible functional connections ( Bullmore and O. Sporns, 2009 ;  Cole et al., 2010 ). To date, GBC has been shown – using fully data-driven approaches – to be a powerful and replicable biomarker to identify major intrinsic brain networks (e.g. cognitive control and default mode networks) ( Cole et al., 2010 ), to correlate with normal brain functions (e.g. cognition and intelligence) ( Cole et al., 2012 ), and to be disrupted in bipolar disorder ( Anticevic et al., 2013 ), schizophrenia ( Anticevic et al., 2015 ), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) ( Anticevic et al., 2014 ). To our knowledge, this unique and reliable voxel-wise whole-brain data-driven GBC biomarker has not yet been fully investigated in MDD ( Gong and Y. He, 2015 ). 
 In the current study, we conducted a whole-brain study of GBC in patients with MDD free of concomitant antidepressant medication and healthy volunteers. Whole-brain analyses were followed by analyses restricted to the VMPFC (including the sgACC) because of the central role of this region in neurocircuit models of depression ( Mayberg et al., 2005 ). Based on the existing literature, we hypothesized that MDD would be characterized by abnormal connectivity primarily localized to midline prefrontal cortical structures. 
 
 
 METHODS AND MATERIALS 
 
 Participants 
 Male and female adults with MDD and healthy control (HC) volunteers were recruited for the current study through an outpatient psychiatric research program at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Inclusion criteria for the MDD group included being in a current major depressive episode and having a primary diagnosis of MDD determined using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Lifetime history of anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, and other comorbidity was likewise assessed using the SCID. Healthy volunteers were free of lifetime psychiatric illness or significant medical conditions. Depressed patients were excluded if they had a lifetime history of a psychotic illness or bipolar disorder, met criteria for alcohol or substance abuse within one year of screening, significant medical illness, or had contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Participants were free of psychotropic medication for a minimum of one week prior scanning, and were free of substances of abuse as determined by a urine toxicology test on the day of scan. Women of childbearing potential were required to test negative on a urine pregnancy test on the day of scan. Depression and anxiety severity at the time of image acquisition was determined using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) ( Montgomery and M. Asberg, 1979 ), and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) ( HAMILTON, 1959 ), respectively. The Program for the Protection of Human Subjects at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai approved the study. After complete description of the study to potential participants, written informed consent was obtained prior to the conduct of any study procedures. 
 
 
 Neuroimaging Data Acquisition 
 Participants underwent MRI with a Philips Achieva 3.0T X-series system using an 8-channel birdcage headcoil for radio frequency transmission and reception. After a localization scan, high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical images were collected using a three-dimensional turbo field echo sequence (3D_TFE; RT: 7.5ms; ET: 3.5ms; voxel dimensions: 1mm × 1mm × 1mm; FOV 224mm × 224mm; flip angle: 8°) and 172 sagittal planes. Resting-state functional data was acquired using a T2*-weighted gradient echo-planar imaging sequence (RT 2000ms; ET 26.6ms; voxel dimensions: 2.2mm × 2.2mm × 3.25mm; FOV 210mm × 210mm; flip angle= 90°, 120 frames) and 38 contiguous and ascending near-axial planes parallel to the intercommissural plane. Total resting state acquisition was 4 minutes. The relatively short scan time was selected to balance acquiring a sufficient amount of data, while minimizing motion artifacts and patients’ burden ( Van Dijk et al., 2010 ). At the beginning of each functional run, the MR signal was allowed to equilibrate over five TRs, which were subsequently excluded from the analysis. Participants were instructed to rest with their eyes open during the resting state scan. 
 
 
 Neuroimaging Processing and Analyses 
 Image processing and analyses were performed using previously validated pipelines utilizing FSL, AFNI, Freesurfer, and in-house written Matlab programs ( Anticevic et al., 2013 ;  Anticevic et al., 2014 ). The preprocessing of each functional scan included the following: brain extraction, motion correction, slice-time correction, spatial smoothing (FWHM 5 mm), high-pass temporal filtering (100 s), boundary-based registration of fMRI to high-resolution T1 images, and nonlinear registration of structural images to a standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template. Considering recent evidence showing the contribution of high-frequency bands to functional connectivity, low-pass temporal filtering was not implemented ( Chen and G. H. Glover, 2015 ;  Gohel and B. B. Biswal, 2015 ;  Lee et al., 2013 ). To ensure BOLD quality across groups, all included scans passed the following criteria: signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) greater than 100, (i.e. the ratio of mean signal over standard deviation for a given slice across the BOLD run ( Anticevic et al., 2013 ;  Anticevic et al., 2014 )) and no BOLD run with a single frame movement greater than 1 functional voxel. To remove spurious signal, the six rigid-body motion parameters, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white matter, and global brain signal were regressed out of each voxel’s time series. Then, time series were extracted from all voxels within each individual’s anatomically defined whole brain grey matter mask. All processing and analyses were conducted in the subject space, except for 2nd level group analyses. We opted not to regress out the temporal derivatives and the quadratic terms because such regression in the current data would have significantly reduced the degree of freedom ( Saad et al., 2013 ). In addition, while global signal regression is a contested processing step, it is very effective procedure for removing motion artifacts ( Power et al., 2014 ). 
 As in previous work ( Cole et al., 2010 ), GBC was computed as the average of each voxel’s time series correlation with every other voxel in the gray matter of the entire brain. The GBC procedure involves computing a Pearson correlation between a given voxel’s time series and every voxel’s time series, transforming all correlations to Fisher z-values, and computing the mean across those Fisher z-values (Fz). This procedure generates a map for each subject where each voxel value represents the mean connectivity of that voxel with the rest of the brain. Individual whole-brain GBC Fz maps were entered into a between-group t-test (MDD vs. HC), co-varying for age and gender. Whole brain analyses were followed by ROI analyses restricted to the vmPFC based on an anatomical atlas ( Desikan et al., 2006 ). Relationships between GBC and depressive symptom severity were examined by means of linear correlation. Type I error correction was based on peak and cluster extent ( Forman et al., 1995 ) ascertained via AFNI’s 3dClustSim using an estimate of smoothness through 3dFWHMx (uncorrected z-value > 2.58 and at least 88 or 23 contiguous voxels for whole-brain and VMPFC-restricted analyses respectively, providing p < .05 cluster-level correction per analysis). Standardize mean differences (SMD) are reported based on Hedges’ g. 
 
 
 
 RESULTS 
 
 Participant Characteristics 
 Eighty-two subjects (57 MDD, 25 HC) completed all MRI procedures. Six subjects (all MDD) had to be excluded for excessive motion, yielding a final sample of 51 MDD and 25 HC subjects. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the study sample are summarized in  Table 1 . The study groups had similar age and gender distributions. 
 
 
 Global Brain Connectivity in Major Depression 
 There were no differences between the study groups in absolute motion (MDD: 0.19 ± 0.1, HC: 0.18 ± 0.1, p = 0.9), relative motion (MDD: 0.14 ± 0.1, HC: 0.12 ± 0.1, p = 0.4), or signal to noise ratio (MDD: 224.4 ± 7.9, HC: 223.8 ±6.8, p = 0.7). To rule out the possibility that there may be group differences in signal variance that could drive any observed group difference in GBC, we examined the variance estimates of global signal variability and found no significant difference between the study groups (p = 0.29). 
 The largest effect size of between-group difference in GBC was observed within the right sgACC (BA 25), extending into the VMPFC bilaterally (BA 11, 32), wherein the MDD group evidenced significantly reduced connectivity compared to the HC group (MNI: 6, −14, −20; SMD = −1.48;  Table 2 ,  Fig. 1 ). Patients with MDD also exhibited reduced GBC within bilateral regions of DLPFC, DMPFC, left VLPFC and left dACC ( Table 2 ,  Fig. 1 ). 
 Compared to the HC group, the MDD group evidence increased connectivity in two posterior brain regions: the posterior cerebellum and the middle occipital cortex, comprising the extrastriate visual cortex ( Table 2 ,  Fig. 2 ). Post hoc analysis was conducted following motion scrubbing (i.e. removing the frames with high motion as well as 1 frame prior to and 2 frames following each of these high motion frames; see ( Power et al., 2012 )), which identified GBC alterations largely in the same brain regions described above (data not shown). 
 To examine the relationship between GBC abnormalities and the severity of depression within the MDD group, we conducted a voxel-wise correlation analysis limited to under or over-connected voxels (relative to HC). This approach has the advantage of specifically examining “abnormal” voxels, thereby reducing the risk of a type II error. We observed an inverse association between GBC and MADRS score within the VMPFC/sgACC (MNI: 2, 30, −16;  r  = −0.44), although this finding did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. We did not find a relationship between age, anxiety, number of prior antidepressant treatments, or number of depressive episodes and GBC within the MDD group. There was a weak inverse association between GBC and duration of illness within the left temporal pole (TP) and left middle occipital cortex (MOC) clusters that did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. 
 
 
 Global Connectivity of the Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex in Major Depression 
 Consistent with our whole-brain analysis, there was significantly reduced GBC in the MDD compared to HC group within the anatomically defined bilateral VMPFC (SMD = 0.82, t=3.4, p=0.001). Within the MDD group, there was an inverse association between GBC and MADRS score that remained significant following correction for multiple comparisons (r = −0.47, p = 0.0005;  Fig. 3 ). Patients with the highest symptom severity had the lowest GBC within the VMPFC. The association between GBC and depression severity remained significant after controlling for age and gender (r=−0.45, p=0.001). 
 
 
 
 DISCUSSION 
 In the current study, MDD was characterized by reduced GBC within multiple regions of PFC, including VMPFC, MPFC, ACC and DLPFC. The largest effect of reduced GBC in the PFC was centered within the sgACC extending into VMPFC bilaterally and higher depression severity was linked to low GBC uniquely within the VMPFC. In addition, we found that MDD was characterized by increased GBC within the cerebellum and visual processing cortex, although these increases were not associated with symptom severity. 
 The GBC metric used in the current study reliably identifies brain regions of high connectivity, potentially reflecting coordinating hubs in large-scale brain networks ( Cole et al., 2010 ). Our finding of reduced GBC of the medial and lateral PFC in MDD is consistent with decreased participation or coordination of these critical integrative regions within their associated networks. The VMPFC and sgACC in particular is a key region within both the DMN and the salience network ( Seeley et al., 2007 ). Including medial PFC structures more broadly, the PCC and regions of parietal cortex, the DMN supports internally directed and self-referential thought and has been implicated in pathological rumination in MDD ( Johnson et al., 2009 ). Previous studies indicate increased activity or failure to reduce activity in these regions in MDD in response to a cognitive or affective challenge ( Sheline et al., 2009 ). Resting state studies utilizing seed based or ICA approaches suggest increased contribution of the VMPFC or ACC to the DMN in MDD ( Kaiser et al., 2015 ). Notably, our finding of reduced GBC in this region is consistent with and extends prior studies since reduced GBC suggests reduced coordination or coherence with other brain structures and networks. Reduced global connectivity of sgACC/VMPFC is consistent with a pathological autonomy of this network hub and its attendant functional consequences of dominating self-referential mental processes and a relative resistance to regulation by cognitive control systems. 
 We observed reduced GBC within regions of lateral PFC and DMPFC, key regions within a cognitive control network that are known to participate in emotion regulation ( Cole and W. Schneider, 2007 ;  Ochsner and J. J. Gross, 2005 ). Prior activation studies have reported under activation of the DLPFC in patients with depression, and enhanced DLPFC activation following antidepressant treatment ( Siegle et al., 2007 ). Our primary findings of reduced GBC within lateral and medial PFC regions are consistent with reduced cognitive flexibility, poor concentration and reduced emotion regulation capacity associated with MDD ( Gotlib and J. Joormann, 2010 ;  Murrough et al., 2011 ). Interestingly, Anticevic et al also reported reduced medial PFC GBC in patients with bipolar disorder compared to healthy volunteers using an analytic method very similar to the method employed in the study ( Anticevic et al., 2013 ). In that study, that majority of patients were receiving medication at the time of scan, and the effect of diagnosis on GBC was driven exclusively by the patients with a history of psychosis. While we likewise observed reduced GBC within overlapping regions of medial PFC, our patients were all unipolar, unmedicated at the time of scan, and without a history of psychosis. Although it is unclear why precisely the patients without a history of psychosis did not show reduced medial PFC connectivity, the two studies are broadly congruent in their implication of medial PFC circuitry as critical to the pathophysiology of mood disorders. 
 While the bulk of our findings consisted of reduced GBC localized to components of the PFC, we also found increased GBC within the dorsal lateral part of the posterior lobe of the cerebellum in MDD compared to HC. The cerebellum is classically involved in motor learning and coordination, although the important role of the cerebellum in cognitive and affective processes has gained increased recognition ( Paradiso et al., 1999 ). The cerebellum has a preponderance of reciprocal connections with subcortical regions important for emotion and autonomic regulation and several studies have linked enhanced cerebellar functioning during an affective challenge specifically to negative affect in humans ( Paradiso et al., 1999 ). A seed-based connectivity analysis in geriatric depression demonstrated reduced cerebellar connectivity with prefrontal regions and increased connectivity with basal ganglia ( Alalade et al., 2011 ). A more recent seed-based connectivity study focusing on the DMN found increased connectivity between the cerebellum and components of the DMN in MDD compared to healthy volunteers ( Guo et al., 2015 ). Although the functional significance of the increased cerebellar GBC in our study remains speculative, hyper-connectivity of phylogenetically old circuitry subserving autonomic regulation is consistent with neurovegetative alterations and exaggerated stress responses observed in MDD. 
 The second region that demonstrated greater GBC in MDD compared to HC in our study was extrastriate visual cortex. As a sensory processing region, the visual cortex is often not included in neurocircuit models of MDD. Prior studies, however, have suggested that components of the visual system may be over-responsive to negative stimuli in MDD, consistent with a negative perceptual bias in MDD ( Keedwell et al., 2010 ;  Surguladze et al., 2005 ). Studies have also linked neural responses within the visual cortex to treatment outcomes in MDD ( Furey et al., 2013 ;  Keedwell et al., 2010 ). Within this context, our finding of heighten GBC within the visual cortex in MDD may reflect a pathological broadening of the interaction between the visual system and other brain systems, which potentially contributes to a negative perceptual bias in MDD. 
 As noted above, our GBC approach provides a unique assessment of whole-brain functional coherence appropriate for examining the large-scale functional organization of the brain and differences in large-scale organization as a function of disease. Seed-based approaches have the potential to bias outcomes since analyses are inherently restricted to the selected regions. Likewise, meta-analyses utilizing seed-based studies inherit the same limitations. A recent study utilizing a FC metric related to degree centrality within the context of graph theory found reduced FC within multiple PFC regions, including the VMPFC, in the MDD compared to the HC group ( Wang et al., 2014 ). Our results are largely consistent with these findings and extend them by utilizing a validated measure of GBC, including MDD patients free of concomitant antidepressant medication, and utilizing a larger sample size. Additional difference between our study and that of Wang et al is that the prior study utilized an arbitrary threshold of r = 0.2, which excluded low or negative correlations, potentially ignoring functionally and clinically relevant connections ( Cole et al., 2010 ). Several other studies have utilized approaches based on graph theory to investigate large-scale network organization in MDD ( Gong and Y. He, 2015 ). These studies provide initial evidence for perturbations in network organization in MDD beyond what is assessed using metrics of coherence or centrality, including modular structure ( Lord et al., 2012 ) and small-world efficiency ( Zhang et al., 2011 ). 
 The current study methods do not allow the interrogation of the underlying molecular processes that give rise to the observed prefrontal dysconnectivity in MDD. However, it is important to highlight that these findings are congruent with the well-described loss of synaptic connectivity in animal models of depression and prolonged stress ( Duman and G. K. Aghajanian, 2012 ). Repeated stress exposure in rodents alters synaptic homeostasis and results in robust reductions in synaptic plasticity and decreased synaptic connectivity within the medial PFC, which drive depressive behavior ( Li et al., 2010 ). Behavioral antidepressant effects following treatment with classic antidepressants or ketamine – a rapid acting antidepressant – are dependent on increases in synaptic structure and function, indicating that this form of neuroplasticity represents a state-dependent effect and that amelioration of deficits in synaptic plasticity may be a mechanism of antidepressant action ( Abdallah et al., 2015 ). While still speculative, our observed reductions in PFC GBC in human depression may reflect underlying deficits in synaptic plasticity and connectivity, akin to what is observed in animal stress models of depression. Alternations within the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis may also contribute to the observed reductions in cortical FC in patients with depression via the impact of glucocorticoids on neuronal plasticity ( McEwen et al., 2015 ;  Pariante and S. L. Lightman, 2008 ). Finally, elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines or other immune factors reported in patients with depression may contribute maladaptive changes in mood-related neurocircuits via both HPA axis-dependent and HPA axis-independent mechanisms ( Felger et al., 2015 ;  Hodes et al., 2014 ;  Hodes et al., 2015 ). 
 Our study has several limitations. This cross-sectional study included only patients with MDD in a current major depressive episode and therefore we are unable to distinguish between state and trait effects. Likewise, longitudinal studies of high-risk individuals would be required to disentangle predisposing vulnerabilities from consequences of the illness. Although GBC is a simple, powerful tool to identify brain regions with impaired overall coherence, GBC cannot capture connectivity impairments between two regions with opposing effects, for e.g. if one region increased correlation by 0.2, while the other decreased correlation by 0.2. Finally, the specific functional consequences of our findings require further study. Our primary finding of reduced GBC within the PFC in MDD spanned several anatomical regions known to participate in multiple large-scale networks, including the DMN, an executive/cognitive control network and an affective or salience network. Future studies utilizing more detailed behavioral evaluations of network-specific functions, such as self-directed processing, emotion perception and threat detection, and emotion regulation will be required to provide a finer mapping of disordered connectivity to behavioral dysfunction in MDD. 
 In conclusion, we found that MDD was characterized by robust reductions in global functionally connectivity of the sgACC, VMPFC and other PFC regions and that low levels of connectivity were linked to the severity of depressive symptoms. These data are consistent with the loss of synaptic connectivity in animal models of depression and suggest a potential human biomarker of stress related depressive pathology. Future studies will be required to determine the molecular causes and functional consequences of these changes in depressive disorders.

 Increased global brain connectivity in major depressive disorder 
 A. Significantly increased GBC in major depressive disorder compared to healthy volunteers within the posterior cerebellum. B. Significantly increased GBC in major depressive disorder compared to healthy volunteers within the left extrastriate visual cortex. C. Histogram of GBC increases in major depressive disorder relative to healthy volunteers across all voxels showing significant group differences. 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 3 
 
 Global brain connectivity within the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in major depressive disorder and association with symptom severity 
 I. Cluster depicts significantly reduced GBC in major depressive disorder patients relative to healthy volunteers within an anatomically defined bilateral VMPFC. II. Inverse linear correlation between GBC within the VMPFC and depressive severity as measured by Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score.
